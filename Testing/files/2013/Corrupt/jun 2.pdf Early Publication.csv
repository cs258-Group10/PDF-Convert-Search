Among 67 transgenic lines, the event-10 showed profuse branching, event-24 showed abnormal growth and the remaining events exhibited single erect phenotype. In addition, the event-24 produced no flower and this might be due to the positional effect of PTM3 gene integration. Southern blot analysis performed for event-10, 24 and 48 showed distinct single copy integrations of PTM3 gene cassette. GUS assay performed using various plant parts of event-10 showed constitutive expression of the transgene. In view of cotton breeding, among all the events, the event-10 was found to be phenotypically significant with earliness of 12 days in flowering and 15 days in maturity and yield enhancement of 27%. In addition, the event-10 showed no square dropping and allowed the plants to bear more number of bolls. Based on these results, event-10 was chosen to carryout the inheritance study of expressed characters in the progeny. Similar to To generation of event-10, the Ti and T2 generation plants exhibited same characteristics of early flowering and maturity with enhancement of yield. ",

M.V.RAMANA RAO "," The LED based Solar Home Lighting System is designed for domestic applications in rural households where electricity is neither available nor accessible. The system employs LEDs as light sources and works on a battery in conjunction with a solar panel and is an efficient replacement of traditional methods like Kerosene lamp, Candle, Incandescent bulb, Fluorescent or CFL lights. The LED based Solar Home Lighting System uses sunlight to activate a solar panel to charge a battery which in turn powers a high intensity LED lamp that provides light for up to 15 hours on a fully charged battery. The system comprises a Solar Photo Voltaic (SPV) module, a Charge controller, a rechargeable battery and one or two LED based luminaires - 2feet tube lights - two nos of 5Watt or one of 9Watt. Optionally LED Bulbs of 5 to 8Watts also may be used. However, the light dispersion is more uniform over the defined target area of a living room or kitchen in respect of the tube light architecture compared to a bulb. The luminaire can as well be used for lighting the front or backyards of a rural household. The LED based luminaires give away high brightness light with very low power consumption and as such the home lighting system requires smaller solar panel and battery compared to those used in other conventional lighting systems or alternatively the backup time is much longer for the LED luminaires for the same panel and battery capacities. The LEDs used in the luminaires have a long life - of more than 50,000 hours - which avoids the costly lamp replacements for several years. The LED based solar home lighting system is also easy to install and use with practically zero maintenance. Further, the LED based luminaires also extend themselves to economical and low cost community lighting solutions for a closely knit pocket or cluster of a small number of houses in the rural environment with slightly increased sizes of panel and battery, and with additional common facilities like street lighting besides home lighting. This is also expected to facilitate the Governments to electrify more rural and underdeveloped regions without the huge investments called for in generating and distributing the grid power to these remote locations.

GUNASEKARAN "," The silkworm pupae biowaste are rich source of oil, protein, minerals and chitin, and could be utilized effectively by improved ecofriendly techniques. Commonly this nutrient rich byproduct of sericulture is simply discarded as a waste and in some places, it is composted like other wastes. This biowaste is not fully exploited for value addition. The dried and deoiled silkworm pupae biowaste contain 47.40 % and 57.75 % protein, 30.49 % and 0.12 % fat and 7.06 % and 5.58 % of ash respectively. The oil content in the dried pupae (30.49 %) was removed by solvent extraction method and only the de-oiled dried pupae was used for further studies. The protease producing bacteria isolated from the environmental soil samples showed a maximum hydrolysis zone of 0.5 cm and a protease activity of 68.6 Units per ml was used for the deproteinization process to extract the aminomass. By means of optimization it was found that a glucose concentration of 3.5 %, pH of 7 and fermentation time of 168 hour, had achieved maximum deproteinization of 91.82 %. The deproteinization process was carried out in pilot scale fermentor (51 volume) with the optimized conditions of deproteinization and achieved about 89.41% of deproteinization and 33.71% of demineralization. About 2.75 litre of aminomass was filtered from the fermented supernatant and separated out which was one of the value added product. The obtained aminomass was yellowish in colour with pH of 4.69 and known to contain 8 aminoacids viz., threonine (1238.8 mg), arginine (852.31 mg), tryptophan(346.04 mg), histidine (182.08 mg), tyrosine (46.29 mg), aspartic acid (43.15 mg), alanine (14.98 mg) and phenyl alanine (6.84 mg) per lOOg of deoiled dried pupae. The lactic acid bacterial isolates were obtained from milk, idli batter, curd and yoghurt samples. Among the isolates, lactic acid bacteria LAB7 showed highest total titratable acidity (0.78 %), compared to rest of the isolates was used for demineralization process. By means of optimization it was found that a glucose concentration of 3.5 %, pH of 5 and fermentation time of 144 hour, had achieved maximum demineralization of 89.67 %.With the optimized parameters for maximum demineralization, the process was carried out in pilot scale fermentor (5 1 volume) and reported 88.95 % of demineralization. Simultaneously 2.70 litre of minerals were filtered and separated out, which was also one of the value added product. Finally, two step scale up of fermentation processes was carried out in 100 litre fermentor involving first with proteolytic fermentation and second with lactic acid fermentation. After the two step fermentation processes, the crude chitin was finally separated out as an additional value added product. The effect of aminomass on the growth of broilers (live weight) was studied which showed that the live weight increased linearly with the increase in dietary treatments and the treatment T4 (feed+100% aminomass) obtained higher live bird weight at the end of final 42 days when compared with control (feed alone without aminomass).

Using the state-of-the-art 2 Mega pixel portable webcams fitted to a fixed stand with rigid optical alignment resembling human eye-balls, the live video is captured simultaneously from both Left and Right eye cameras. The frames so captured are processed by applying proprietary 'Adaptive Color Coding Techniques' on each of the frames. The resultant frames are displayed on the target LED screen either of Standard aspect ratio of 4:3 or of Wide Screen aspect ratio of 16:9. Viewers wearing Special Adaptive Color Coding Spectacles can view the content on the LED screen in 3D mode. Proprietary indigenous solutions are employed to meet (Capturing, Processing and Displaying) resolutions of QVGA, VGA, SVGA and HD modes, both in standard / widescreen formats, with 25 frames per second (fps). The principle can be extended to higher Frame rates and to other resolution modes; to develop 3D LED Display viewable with naked eyes (without spectacles); and also to deploy dynamic stereoscopic techniques to display 2D content in 3D. When proprietary 4-in-l RGBY chip LEDs are used in the display (in place of 3-in-l RGB chip LEDs), the picture quality improves drastically (manifold). Several embodiments of 3D viewing techniques on the conventional 2D True Colour LED Video Displays were discussed in the prior art - in which schemes of content processing, Display device enhancements and viewing methodologies have been adopted in order that a viewer can experience the joy of seeing a 3D video content. Virtual 3D effects have been simulated and demonstrated on multiple segments of 2D display screens arranged in succession with the depth dimension in between. Manifestation of 3D in the True Colour LED Video Displays has also been achieved by means of deploying a proprietary 4-in-l RGBY chip LED in the display screens which encompasses the depth dimension of the image in addition to the colour, thereby augmenting the display with 3D capabilitiesPresent invention is based on the deployment of proprietary colour coding processes to develop the 3D content from 2 live camera inputs positioned precisely with a distance between them equal to the distance between the two eyes of a typical human being and feed to the True Colour LED Video Display screen or an LED TV; and use colour polarised eye-glasses for viewing 3D videos on the screens. In this method, two distinct frames produced from the two cameras, are processed and merged simultaneously to produce the effect of 3D and are presented to the two eyes by means of a pair of colour polarised filters.

It is known through prior art that silver based antimicrobial compositions for water purification undergo decrease in performance upon continuous use, which leads to a need for the replacement of composition. It is to be noted that the composition still has large quantity of active ingredient and its replacement leads to increase in the cost of the technology. We show simple methods of reactivation which are easy to implement in field and requires no special equipment. The methods described in the present invention help in regaining 100% antimicrobial activity of the composition. The cycle, in use ? performance drop ? reactivation, can be repeated several times. Reactivation has been demonstrated by physical and chemical or reaction-based approaches. A simple method of physical reactivation is treating the composition with hot water (around 70 °C) for about 3 hours. A simple method of chemical or reaction based reactivation is treating the composition either with an etching agent or an anti- scaling agent. The process of reactivation has been found to be applicable for a broad range of silver metal particles based antimicrobial compositions and is independent of nature of support matrix or surface protecting agent.

This was modified with APTES (3- aminopropyltriethoxysilane) and APTMS (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane), to introduce amine functional group which was used for linking FITC and folic acid. The synthesized and modified materials were characterized by FE-SEM, HR-TEM, VSM, FT-IR, XPS, XRD, BET and 29Si-NMR. The magnetic contrast property of the modified iron oxide incorporated mesoporous silica (Fe203-SBA-15) was analyzed with 4.6 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system using phantom assay. The magnetic silica showed excellent longitudinal (R1) and transverse relaxivities (R2) with an R2/R1 ratio close to 1 indicating the potential of this material to be a good magnetic contrast agent. The biocompatibility of the modified material was analyzed through the cell- viability studies with MC3T3 fibroblast cell lines and cell-uptake with Y79 retinoblastoma cell lines in the presence and absence of magnetic silica. Our results demonstrated no significant change in the cell viability between the concentration range 31.3 µg/mL and 250 µg/mL. The tissue compatibility studies using animal models indicated no toxic manifestations. It can be classified as a level II biomaterial. Biodistribution of the magnetic mesoporous silica showed that a major part of the material was eliminated within 60 hours and the magnetic mesoporous silica showed maximum accumulation in the spleen.As the modified iron oxide incorporated mesoporous (Fe2O3-SBA-15) silica has high surface area and porosity, it could also be used as a drug carrier. The presence of large number of functionalities aid in covalent linking of the targeting moieties while, superparamagnetic property of iron oxide in the pores of modified mesoporous silica helps to differentiate the cancerous cell through MRI imaging.

Image quality is assessed for a digital image that is a composite of tiles or other image segments, especially focus accuracy for a microscopic pathology sample. An algorithm or combination of algorithms correlated to image quality is applied to pixel data at margins where adjacent image segments overlap and thus contain the same content in separately acquired images. The margins may be edges merged to join the image segments smoothly into a composite image, and typically occur on four sides of the image segments. The two versions of the same image content at each margin are processed by the quality algorithm producing two assessment values. A sign and difference value are compared with other image segments including by subsets selected for the orientation of the margins on sides on the image segments. The differences are mapped to displays. Selection criteria determine segments to be reacquired.  55 No. of Claims : 22 The Patent Office Journal 14/06/2013 13183 (12) PATENT APPLICATION PUBLICATION (21) Application No.2841/KOLNP/2012 A (19) INDIA 26/09/2012 (43) Publication Date : 14/06/2013  TUNING PEG FOR A STRINGED INSTRUMENT G10D3/14 10157648.6 24/03/2010 ","EPO ","PCT/EP2011/054570 ","24/03/2011 ","WO 2011/117367 ","NA ","NA ","NA ","NA "," 1)GOODBUY CORPORATION S.A.

This protein, designated PD-L3 OR VISTA resembles members of the PD-L1 family, identified a novel and structurally-distinct, Ig-superfamily inhibitory ligand, whose extracellular domain bears homology to the B7 family ligand PD-L1. This molecule is designated as PD-L3 OR VISTA or V- domain Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA). Expression of VISTA is primarily within the hematopoietic compartment and is highly regulated on myeloid APCs and T cells. Therapeutic intervention of the VISTA inhibitory pathway represents a novel approach to modulate T cell-mediated immunity for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers, e.g., ovarian, bladder cancer and melanomas. Also, VISTA proteins, especially multimeric VISTA proteins and antibodies may be used to suppress T cell immunity in autoimmune disease, allergy, infection and inflammatory conditions, e.g. multiple sclerosis and artritic conditions such as RA.

Various features of the method are selectively controlled to achieve a profile that has increased transverse strength and flexural modulus. For example, the layer of continuous fibers is formed from one or more continuous fiber reinforced ribbons (CFRT) that contain fibers embedded within a thermoplastic polymer matrix. The fibers are embedded within the matrix by a process that minimizes void fraction and in turn, optimizes flexural modulus. Further, the ribbon(s) are consolidated so that the continuous fibers remain fixed in alignment in a substantially longitudinal direction (e.g., the direction of pultrusion). In addition to enhancing the tensile properties of the profile, the use of such ribbons also allows the continuous fiber material to be more readily manipulated and placed into the desired position within the pultrusion die. The discontinuous fibers are also embedded within a thermoplastic matrix. Among other things, this may assist in bonding of the layers so that an adhesive is not required to achieve the desired strength. Also, rather being oriented in the longitudinal direction, at least a portion of the fibers are oriented in the transverse direction to provide increased transverse strength. ",
