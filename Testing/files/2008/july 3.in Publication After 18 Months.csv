Even  though several direct compressible adjutants are available but no single adjuvant fulfills the entire optimum requirements for directly  compressible material. the entire optimum requirements for directly compressible material. The purpose of present study was to  evaluate the suitability of tapioca starch (TS) as DC excipient. The tapioca starch was evaluated for parameters like particle  morphology, particle size, angle of repose, moisture content, ash value, bulk density, tapped density, percentage compressibility,  Hausner ratio, swelling capacity, pH and microbial test. These evaluated parameters were found within the limit. Directly  compressible tablets of trimethoprim were prepared using TS as DC excipient in percentage range of 10% to 55%. the prepared tablets  were evaluated for post compression parameters like hardness, friability, weight variation, disintegration test and dissolution profile.  hardness of the prepared trimethoprim tables was within limit (except formulation F9 and F10) indicating good mechanical strength  during handling and transportation. Friability of the tablets was found to be in rage of 0.120 to 0.190 (except F9 and F 10)% and the  prepared tablets disintegrated in 0.8 minutes to 5.2 minutes, which was within the pharmacopoeial limits. More then 98.56% of the  drug was dissolved in 10 minutes (except F9 and F10). Thus it can be concluded from the studies done so far that TS could be used as  directly compressible adjuvant, disintegrating agent and superdisintegrant in different dosage forms.      ",

(72)Name of Inventor :  1)NABEEL MARK JADEED  2)CHARLES FRANK BENJEY  3)DONALD F. HEANEY   (57) Abstract :  Structures and methods for hindering molded part deformation during densification are discussed. Such devices and techniques can  help alleviate stresses that tend to result in part deformation during firing, sintering, or other densification processes, and thus reduce  the need for secondary straightening operations post-densification. In some instances, a support structure is utilized to orient a molded  greenbody in a preferred direction to reduce deformation during firing (e.g., orienting a thin tail section is a plane parallel to the  direction of gravity). The support structure can also be part of, or the entirety of, a thermal mass to help alleviate stresses that lead to  part deformation. Though such structures and methods can be used for any molded piece, it can be particularly used to create a  portion, or an entirety of, a medical device such as a jaw of an surgical instrument.

The blast air is blown in, transverse to the air treatment channel. The blast air  thereby forms a double twist in yarn run direction as well as against the yarn run direction, for generating the knots. For this, it is  suggested that the blast air in the inlet region into the yarn treatment channel gets converted in a short air twist chamber in yarn  channel longitudinal direction into two strong, steady twist flows undisturbed by filament bundles. In spite of the tiny nature of the air  twist chamber, which projects max. 0.5 mm or 5% to 22% of the yarn channel width (B) beyond the yarn channel longitudinal wall,  the regularity of the knots can be highly improved. It is further possible, depending on the pressure of the blast air, to generate hard or  soft knots that get released again.      ",

In the case of purely mechanical fibre condensing, the fibre strand to be condensed  is drawn through a tapering and continually curved condensing slit, whereby the fibre strand is increasingly condensed. As the fibre  strand glides over a surface which is convex in design and which forms the base of the condensing slit, a certain drafting force acts  on the fibres due to the curve of the base, which drafting force leads to a normal force which presses the fibres to the base of the  slit. This normal force has, as a consequence, a fractional force, which prevents the condensed fibre strand from spreading out again  during transport. The base of the slit is preferably V-shaped in cross section. This results in a particularly intensive condensing. In  an embodiment of the present invention, the base of the slit is continued at the end of the condensing slit by a fibre guiding surface,  also convex in shape, of the condensing element. As a result, when the fibres of the fibre strand exit out of the condensing slit, they  continue to be on a curved surface. Due to the occurring drafting forces, the fibres are pressed onto this curved surface, whereby in  connection with the hereby occurring friction, a spreading but of the fibre strand in transverse direction is avoided, even when it  leaves the condensing slit. It is hereby advantageous when, before it reaches the nipping line, the fibre strand is guided  longitudinally along a part of the periphery of a delivery roller of the delivery roller pair. In the case of this delivery roller, an upper  roller or a base roller can be involved here. Thus the fibres remain under a certain tension downstream of the fibre guiding surface,  in that they continue to lie on a curved surface, which prevents the loss of the condensing effect. It is advantageous when the curved  condensing element is hereby pressed against one of the delivery rollers. In a further embodiment of the present invention, a  similarly convex-shaped intake guiding surface of the condensing element can precede the base of the slit at the slart of the  condensing slit, which intake guiding surface is pressed against a nipping roller of a nipping roller pair arranged upstream of the  condensing element. This is not absolutely necessary for condensing, but results in the advantage that the condensing element can  be better aligned along this nipping roller. The pressure of the fibre guiding surface and/or the intake guiding surface can occur by  means of a preferably adjustable loading spring at the relevant delivery roller or nipping roller. The condensing element can be so  designed that the condensing slit can be formed by lateral ribs or the like. The condensing slit can, however, also be molded into a  condensing element made preferably of ceramic.   ",

In addition to the reduction in the risk of contamination the present invention can reduce the use  of chemicals such as adhesives and bonding agents. In one embodiment of the present invention, at least one curvilinear channel is  provided in a support member. In another embodiment of the present invention, at least one straight channel is provided in a support  member. In a further embodiment of the present invention, a ' curvilinear channel of less than semi-circular cross section is provided  in a support member, and the flexible tubing is attached to the support member in the curvilinear channel. In another embodiment of  the present invention, a curvilinear channel of a cross section slightly larger than a semi-circle is provided in the support member, and  the flexible tubing is snapped into place in the support member. In a still further embodiment of the present invention, flexible  tubing is held in place in annular channels provided in a two-piece support member with the support members being bonded or held to  each other. In a still further embodiment of the invention, an annular channel is molded in a support member and supported by spokes.  In a further embodiment of the invention, a pair of opposed mirror image support members is connected by a hinge, with each support  member having a like annular or curvilinear channel formed therein to cover and enclose the flexible tubing when said pieces of said  support device are closed and snapped into their retained condition. Alternatively, a similar embodiment can be made wherein the  support member, which encases the tube, is formed as a single unit, and the tube is either formed inside the support unit or is later  threaded through the support.

Further, at least in one partial spark gap (1 , 2) there is arranged an additional electrode (10) whose voltage is set to  a given level by means of second voltage distribution means. The voltage level of the additional electrode (10) is changed by  disturbing the voltage distribution of the second voltage distribution means. Thus the spark gap between the main electrode (6a, 6b) of  the partial spark gap (1) and the additional electrode (10) will be ignited. Capacity of the second voltage distribution means is lower  than that of the first voltage distribution means and consequently the voltage acting over the first voltage distribution means does not  change significantly. Thus the voltage determined by the first voltage distribution means acts over the spark gap that is between the  additional electrode (10) and the second main electrode (6a, 6b) of the partial spark gap (1) and that will also ignite, which further  results in the supply voltage (U) acting only over the second partial spark gap (2), whereby a spark-over will also occur therein.
