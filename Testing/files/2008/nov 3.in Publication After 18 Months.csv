The leakage power reduction is achieved by incorporating a central programmable controller in the SoC architecture. The  scheme is based upon the concept of utilizing existing standard JTAG compliant test structures of idle SoC peripherals to place them  into an Absolute Minimum Power consumption state with respect to static and dynamic power. Every CMOS digital circuit has a  Minimum Leakage Vector (MLV) corresponding to which the circuit consumes the lowest amount of leakage power. The Power  Control Module (PCM) shifts in a Minimum Leakage Vector (MLV) into SoC peripheral either on request during normal run mode of  operation or during the SoC boot up, using scan chains and test mode logic. These MLV are stored internally within the PCM in an  internal PCM ROM. This approach significantly reduces leakage power consumption while avoiding the use of complex on chip  analog switches while maintaining a balance between battery life and SoC performance (throughput).

Filed U/S 5(2) before The   Patents (Amendment)   Act, 2005: NO  (57) Abstract :  A strap includes an elongate sheet of material with two end portions and a central portion. Each of the end portions is provided with a  hook dimensioned and configured to receive the plastic handles of a shopping bag or the like. The strap may be plastic injection  molded. The strap may be uniform thickness or may be selectively reduced in thickness to save material and weight in those regions  where the extra material is not essential to the integrity of the strap. A hinge is provided between the central and end portions to allow  the end portions to deflect or bend out of the plane of the central portion under the weight of supported bags. This allows the bad  holder to respond to the weight of the bags while maintaining the central portion substantially flat to avoid excessive bending and  possible compression and pain to the hand of the user.

Sleep apnea is  classified as Central Sleep Apnea (CSA), Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Mixed Sleep Apnea. Detection and differentiation of all  the forms of apnea is desired for proper diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. Existing monitors based only on respiration movement  signals are unable to detect OSA separately, as the respiration movements persist despite the cessation of air flow. The monitoring  system introduced herein separately detects all the forms of sleep apnea only by the information from abdominal and thoracic  excursion signals. CSA is reported if no or very small respiration movements occur for a predefined interval of 10 seconds. OSA  episode is said to occur when the abdominal and the thoracic excursion signals go out of phase. The developed monitor is based only  on simple electronics hardware and circumvents the need for software integration.      ",

PARTHASARATHI BHATTACHARYYA   ","  Accordingly there is provided a device designed and configured according to the features of the invention which essentially allows  filtration of smoking air while passing through water or a liquid chemical that will filter the tar and other piroproducts of paper and  tobacco leaves. The device is a very simple one. There is a container with a cap to fit airtight. This cap on its outer surface can fit to  another container when placed over the first container. After fitting both the containers there is a potential space between the two. The  cap has three holes at the top. The central hole is meant to fix airtight a small capped tube which is meant for cleaning and filling the  inner (first) container. The other two holes are there to fit two tubes designated as (i) the underwater/underliquid arm (ii) the inhalation  arm. These arms are also fixed airtight. Both of them are L shaped. The underwater arm has its limb inside the container near to the  bottom of it and outside it is bent to 90° to end at a small distance to fit to a metal adapter for the smoking means. The smoking arm is  extended to a small distance into the container with its outer part bend 90° opposite to the outer end of the underwater arm. The outer  end of this arm will be meant to adapt the appropriate tubing for smoking (inhalation). The container will be partially filled by  water/liquid chemical. A plastic floating sheave may be optionally provided to float above the liquid or multiple fixed plastic or metal  sheaves may be placed inside as an adjunct to allow better filtration by way of delaying and fracturing the bubbles inside the liquid.  Such purpose may be served by placing submerged steel wool also. A stand may be designed for the device to rest. In a specific  embodiment of the device, both the cap and the container have their walls formed of at least two layers / walls with a potential space  in between. The outer wall / sheath of the container is fixable by threading over a plurality of grooves configured on the outer surface  of the inner sheath of the cap. Or more simply, there can be one container that fits to the inner sheath of the cap on inner aspect and a  second container can be placed on top of the first one that fits airtight on to the outer aspect of the sheath of the cap in such a fashion  that there is a potential space in between the walls of the two container.
