This electricity is used directly or is stored in  battery banks to be used later to give basic lighting using LED’s or to run small devices such as radio, mobile battery chargers, etc  or other devices as per our requirements. We propose a new system to generate electricity by either harnessing the motion of a rotating  fan or harnessing the wind energy produced by the rotating fan. When the fan is in motion we couple it with a generator or use small  blades which are rotated by the wind generated by the rotating fan. This in turn produces electricity which is stored in a battery bank.  This stored energy is later used to run LED lighting providing us basic lighting or small devices such as radio or charging mobile  phone batteries etc irrespective of the fan being ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’. During motion of the fan, the energy produced can be  used directly for running LED lights or small devices via a full wave bridge rectifier circuit. Ceiling fans, table fans, exhaust fans and  similar devices can also be coupled to our system.    ",

The orientation of magnetic forces of the Rotor and Stator components is accomplished with the proper geometrical relationship of  these components and allowing them to influence each other selectively in a specific direction during a specific sequence in time. The  Rotor comprises of several Rotor magnets mounted on a non-magnetic Rotor disc.

Limiting conditions of ohmic loss and polarization effects of electrodialysis process are effectively  addressed by introduction of an ionic liquid in dilute stream. A novel electro-electrodialysis cell design with bipolar and cation ion  exchange membranes and appropriate electrodes is presented to achieve production of caustic soda, chlorine and fresh water with  appreciable energy efficiency. Energy consumption is 1976 kWhr, for 1 Ton of chlorine, 1.07 Tons of caustic soda, which is  significant improvement over the energy consumption of a typical chlor-alkali plant. In addition 51M3 of fresh water is also produced  free of cost.     ",

The chest piece consist of two  piezoelectric transducer mounted on to the diaphragm. One transducer for picking up body sounds for auscultation and other  transducer with seismic mass which resonates at body sound frequencies, generating electric charge which can be efficiently used to  charge the battery resulting in a longer battery life. This construction also includes a wireless charging apparatus based on principle of  induction and RF wireless charging. The noise cancellation arrangement of the chest piece consists of vents on the opposite side of the  sensing diaphragm. The diaphragm side of transducer is subjected to sound pressure level corresponding to body sound and ambient  noise were as the vent side of the transducer is subjected to sound pressure level corresponding to ambient noise. The resultant  pressure level on piezoelectric transducer will be body sounds eliminating common mode ambient noise.     ",

The .experiment has been carried out successfully and II) In a textile mill there is a blower plant which is running  24 Hours. During the Operation of the Plant wind is generated and blown through the blower for remove the 90tton waste and other  dust particles by reusing the expected wind energy electricity can be generated by using the wind to pass through a fan specially  designed for this purpose. .III) Ele~tricity is generated through windmill by using 3 long blades as per the exiting structure after  making some alternations as the wings as shown in the drawing more electricity can be generated with less wind power.
