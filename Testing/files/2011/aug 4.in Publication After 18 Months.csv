The sorption of oxyanions on surfactant modified zeolite (SMZ) may be attributed to surface complexation and  surface precipitation. Incorporation of metal ions on SMZ showed improved anion uptake for dearsnification of water probably due to  synergistic effect and is able to meet the stringent target of 10 ppb of As on portable water being adopted by most of the countries.  High selectivity, faster kinetics and high adsorption capacity ensures cost effectiveness of this product as compared to other low cost  products for dearsenification.

For example, an embodiment of the apparatus includes a first processor, a second processor (also referred herein as a sleep  processor), and one or more peripheral devices. The peripheral devices are coupled to the first processor and the sleep processor  through a computer bus architecture. During an active mode of operation, the first processor interacts with and controls the functions  of the peripheral devices. In an embodiment, the sleep processor also interacts with and controls the functions of the peripheral devices  during the active mode of operation. However, when the first processor is in a sleep mode of operation, the sleep processor is  configured to control one or more functions of the computer system incorporating the first processor and the sleep processor. These  functions can, include applications that may not otherwise be executed while the first processor is in sleep mode such as, for example,  functions of the one or more peripheral devices. These functions can also include applications that are not computationally intensive  such that the sleep processor can execute the functions at a slower clock frequency, over a longer period of time. In having the sleep  processor execute these simpler functions, the first processor does not expend a significant amount of power on these types of  applications. As a result, power management of the computer system is improved since the first processor remains in sleep mode for a  longer period of time. Fig.2    ",

At the sear seffing, the valve is capable of providing additional gas flow to the gas burner to  provide the intense heat needed to sear food. At the remaining settings, the valve is capable of providing an appropriate amount of gas  flow for conventional cooking of food. Another embodiment of the gas valve is adapted to reduce the rotational offset between the off  position and the maximum flow position as compared to the valves of the prior art. In that embodiment, the angular offset between the  off position and the maximum flow position is approximately 45°. Another embodiment described herein relates to a burner tube  configuration comprising a plurality of standard burner tubes and at least one supplementary sear-zone burner tube which is operable  independently from the standard burner tubes. The sear-zone burner tube supplements the heat generated by the adjacent standard  burner tubes to supply the intense heat needed to sear food.

That is, gestures in the second category will typically be invoked after a gesture in the first category has  already been invoked.

The context objects (502) represent information and experiences that are contextually associated with media content to  enable users to easily discover content and experiences that they will find interesting in a rich and personal manner. As a user  navigates from a content item (508) to a context object (502) in the halo (505), the context object (502) itself morphs into content that  is then surrounded by a new halo of context objects to which the user may navigate.

MRINAL K.GHOSE   ","  Pollution levels at industrial sites generally are affected not only by activities being carried out at the site itself, but also by activities in  surrounding areas. This specification examines the possibility of distinguishing the amounts of pollutants that are being contributed by  different sources. As a part of the EIA process, the air pollution control authority must assess the proposed projects actual potential  impacts on air quality in and around the surrounding locations. Because of the high levels of air pollution found at the site, the  regulatory agency was raising objections to renewing the coal washerys operating license. Washery officials argued that fly ash from  the power plant was significantly increasing pollution levels at the washery premises. Such cases are many for many other industries.  However, this specification reveals that historically there have been no well-defined guidelines for evaluating such impacts . The  drawback within the known art and the object of invention have discussed . In order to resolve these issues, an well designed research  has been conducted to invent a noble method of quantifying air pollutants contribution from multiple sources with factal analysis .  This specification discusses the essentiality of such invention to assess their impacts on air quality and to take appropriate control  measures for sustainability . This specification focuses on the fact that the impacts of pollutants on ambient air quality depend in part  on micrometeorological conditions, especially wind velocity and wind direction. Wind direction can change from season to season,  and thus can cause air pollutants to disperse to different locations at different times of the year. The research discussed here, we  utilized factal analysis techniques based on climatological conditions in order to assess the study projects actual contribution of  pollutants to ambient air quality and to evaluate pollutant dispersion within the surrounding area . For real life application of this  invention a large coal washery was chosen and implemented successfully. To evaluate the actual contribution of air pollutants by  washery and thermal power plant factal analysis techniques were adopted Approach to the selection of air monitoring stations for  factal analysis and methodology adopted for air quality survey have been described. Three season data were generated and the status  of air pollution has been evaluated. The data were critically analyzed on the basis of changes in wind directions at different seasons,  the proportion of ash and volatile matter in washery dust and TPP fly ash, microscopic examination of the SPM by identification of  black dust from the coal washery and whitish gray dust from power plant, the actual contribution of pollutants by the washery and  thermal power plant were evaluated. The results obtained by different techniques were found to be comparable. This invention  provides a sort of fundamental new scientific insight for the determination of actual contribution of air pollutants from different  sources in the area , which can be utilized to evaluate their impacts and for taking effective mitigation as well.
