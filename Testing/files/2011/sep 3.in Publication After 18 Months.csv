As  Arsenic and chromium occurs naturally in the earths crust. When rocks, minerals, and soil erode, they release arsenic and chromium  into groundwater. Arsenic and chromium occurs naturally in varying amounts in groundwater in various parts of country from ppb  level to ppm level. The average concentration of arsenic and chromium as per USEPA standard in drinking water it is 13 parts per  billion and 0.1 ppm (100 ppb) respectively. In drinking water the level of chromium is usually low as well, but contaminated water  may contain the dangerous Chromium(III) & chromium(Vl). Although Chromium(III) is an essential nutrient for humans and  shortages may cause heart problems, disruptions of metabolisms and diabetes. But the uptake of too much chromium(lll) can cause  health effects as well, for instance skin rashes. Chromium(VI) is known to cause various health effects Skin rashes, upset stomachs,  respiratory problems, weakened immune systems, kidney and liver damage and lung cancer The persons who are drinking water  having upto 50 ppb of arsenic and 0.1 ppm chromium over for many years could experience skin damage or problems with their  circulatory system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer. Keeping the above facts we developed a cost effective  nanoparticles for the removal of Arsenic and chromium from potable water upto potable range.    ",

The light module further comprises an modulator (115) capable of modulating the primary light sources  enabling embedment of data in the light emitted. The modulator (115) is arranged to modulate the color coordinates of the light  emitted for embedding the data. This is especially advantageous as the sensitivity of the human eye to changes in color is lower than to  changes in intensity. The invention thus advantageously allows embedding the data into the light emitted from the light modules (110)  of an illumination system (100) without reducing the performance of its primary function as an aid to human vision.

In some cases the  defined value is a predefined value (e.g., zero or some other value), in some cases the defined value is based on noise and/or signals  levels in the system. In some implementations a device may define receive data values for a period of time during which data is  expected to be received and during which a transmission occurs. In some aspects a hybrid on-off keying scheme is employed to  determine received data values.    ",

This combination of treatments can stimulate an immune response at irradiated and non-irradiated sites, which is  useful in eradicating cancer cells that have spread from the site of the primary tumor. In addition, immunocytokines can be  administered at a dose that is less that the maximum tolerated dose, which reduces the side effects associated with immunocytokine  therapy.    ",

This is advantageous, particularly when using the barrier arrangement for high voltages above 500 kV. Simultaneously,  nearly identical barrier arrangements can be used for very different operating voltages, and need to be adjusted only with regard to the  barrier elements and the constant spacing to the cable duct.
