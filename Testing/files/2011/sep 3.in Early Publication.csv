The banks of Supercapacitors have been used to recover kinetic energy from an electric operated two wheeler,  thus partially salvaging the heat energy previously dissipating due to friction. Kinetic energy which gets converted into heat energy in  conventional braking is converted into useful energy and stored in supercapacitors in the developed system. The supercapacitor bank  provides assistance to the battery during starting/acceleration, thereby improving the life of the battery. The recovering of the braking  energy is done using frictional brakes along with electronic brakes, wherein the electronic brake is applied via Single Pole Single  Throw (SPST) switch before the mechanical brake to decelerate the vehicle. The invention also deals with a modified brake lever,  which decides how the mechanical and the regenerative brakes work to stop the bike. The present invention also describes the use of  DC hub machine, capable of motoring and regeneration to eliminate the mechanical power transmission system and separate generator  and thereby recapture energy during regeneration more efficiently.
