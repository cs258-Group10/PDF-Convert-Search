Another  aspect of the invention is the invention is a software program loaded on a host computer that assimilates measured data from multiple  measurement devices over a wired / wireless communication network. The communication network used for data transmission may be  one of combination of wired/wireless Ethernet, telephone line, power line. A unique aspect of the invention is that each measurement  device in a network gets an automatic MAC ID which is used by the software for polling each device for collecting measured data. By  polling every device sequentially, the software manages to streamline data collection and not cause excessive noise on the  communication network whose primary function might be to carry a utility such as power, water, gas, etc. The measurement device  may also consist of an embedded sensor for sensing environmental or operating parameters such as temperature, light intensity,  humidity, pressure, etc. Sensed data may be transmitted along with the utility usage data or in separate data packets on the  communication network. Assimilated data is used for modeling and displaying periodic (which could be near real-time) utility usage  pattern on the host computer and subsequently broadcast over the internet to a remote location or website. Another aspect of the  invention is data collection on the same communication network and the display of usage summary for various utilities such as power,  water and gas individually or combined on the same computer user interface. Having one interface for multiple utilities could provide  residential or enterprise user a common billing interface for multiple utility providers. A two way communication between the  measurement device and the control software would facilitate implementation of optimization techniques to improve uptime of  devices consuming the utility and to reduce cost by minimizing waste of utility.

The process involves a local indigenous soil fungus isolated  and characterized by the inventor. The fungal isolate identified preliminarily as a non sporing fast growing Deuteromycete coded  RaVy F190 was found capable of even utilizing lignins as the sole carbon source accompanied by production of H2O2. The fungus  RaVy F190 was used to breakdown lignins and other poly phenols in autoclaved alkali lignin extracts from sawdust over a high pH  range 5-10 under aerobic static incubation at ambient temperature 25-32 degree Celsius resulting in very high, more than 90%,  removal of colour and reduction of COD. The fungus RaVy F190 secreted lignin peroxidases. The mechanism of breakdown of  lignins and powerful decolourisation was found to be hydrogen peroxide mediated and was closely associated with rapid primary  metabolism completed within 12-24 hours depending on concentration of kraft pulp effluent. The upper liquid column of broth in the  laboratory reactor was optically clear.
