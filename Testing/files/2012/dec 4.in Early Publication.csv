About 60% of newborn infants are jaundiced ,that  is they look yellow. Jaundice can often be seen well in the sclera, the whites of the eyes,whick look yellow. Infants with neonatal  jaundice are treated with coloured light called phototherapy. Phototherapy works through a process of isomerisation that changes  trans- bilirubin into the water-soluble cis-bilirubin isomer. In Phototherapy, blue light is typically used because it is more effective at  breaking down bilirubin. The efficiency of the treatment was measured by the rate of decline of serum bilirubin, which in excessive  amounts causes jaundice, concentration after 6, 12, 24 hours of light exposure. A more rapid response was obtained using the blue  lamps than the green lamps. However, a shorter phototherapy recovery period was noticed in babies exposed to the green lamps.

The PV Panels are placed at a particular angle so as to receive the light from the receiver tube and from  the normal radiance of the sun. There is a lot of light being emitted by the receiver tube in a regular parabolic trough, this light is  usually wasted. I have incorporated PV Panels in the line of emission to ensure than the emitted light is absorbed by the panels and  this also increases the performance of the PV Panels. The PV Panels do not interfere in the solar thermal power production process  and the performance of the parabolic troughs. I have also placed PV Panels at the outer ends of the parabolic trough. The PV Panels  will move along with the parabolic trough and track the sun through the day. As there is a lot of heat involved, I have strategically  placed a solar driven cooling fan above the PV Panels. This will help in cooling the PV Panels and will boost their performance. Thus,  I have created a design where there is maximum utility of the radiance which results in increase in output. Tracking is also simplified  in my invention. The tracking is done using a steel cable that holds and aids in the movement of the parabolas while tracking the sun.  The parabola is pulled from the bottom by means of 10mm steel cable in Sun Dial real time tracking. The entire parabolas movement  is known as planetary movement. It requires very low torque. The use of both concentrated solar power application in terms of a  parabolic trough and utilization of Photo Voltaic Panels makes my invention Hybrid. With my invention there is more power  generated in the same space. More over the power derived from the PV Panels will be used to drive the entire tracking system. Thus  there is no extra need for electricity and the entire project is renewable.   ",

In the Dual Principle Steel Cable  Tracking System, maintenance is very less and there is low consumption of water for cleansing. This is because after sunset the PV  Panels and Booster Mirrors are in a vertical position to prevent any dust or matter settling on the surface. This is important as any  settlement on the panels could detriment productivity. An additional feature is that in case of high wind velocity the tracking system  will send the Photovoltaic Panels and the Booster Mirrors to resting position to prevent any damage to the panels. The Dual Principle  Steel Cable Tracking System can be applied for 36 kilo watts to 1 mega watt of PV installations with Booster Mirrors.   ",
