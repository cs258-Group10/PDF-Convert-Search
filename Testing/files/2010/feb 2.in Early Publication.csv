In General the protection device can be coupled to all  Direct -on - line motor starters used along with 3 phase motors. In this device each phase current in sensed with a respective Current  Transformer. Single phasing, over load and extra over load are decided by comparison with a reference current. Single phasing and  line breaks are decided by minimum current required in each phase for continuation of controller functions. Controllers are made to  suit definite loads. Continuously variable presets are not used. The operations are processed through a tamper proof schedule and  timing program.    ",
