Conventional testing of these multi-tiered assemblies in not only slow and wasteful, but sometimes requires the assemblies to include  extra ground contacts that can disrupt normal circuit operation. Accordingly, the present inventors have devised unique test probes and  related systems and methods for testing these electronic assemblies. One unique probe structure includes at least one signal contact  surface (122) for contacting a signal-port trace (611) of an electronic assembly and at least one substantially larger ground contact  surface (166.2.) for contacting a ground pad (614) of the electroni c assembly. In another, the ground probe (160) has a contact surface  (166.2) and a non-contact surface (166.1) for overhanging a portion of a signal-port trace (611) and thereby establishing a desired  characteristic impedance. These and other presented probe structures lacilitalc more rapid and cost-effective testing of electroni c  assemblies.     '

The power plant hydrogen fuel source 4 can be gasoline,  diesel fuel, or other like fuels which contain relatively high levels of organic sulfur compounds such as mercaptans, sulfides,  disulfides, and the like. The undiluted hydrocarbon fuel supply is passed through a nickel reactant desul furizer bed 8 wherein  essentially all of the sulfur in the organic sulfur compounds reacts with the nickel reactant, and is converted to nickel sulfide, while the  now desulfuri zed hydrocarbon fuel supply continues through the remainder of the fuel processing system. The method involves adding  hydrogen 34 to the fuel stream prior to the desulfurizing step. The method can be used to desulfurize either a liquid or a gaseous fuel  stream. The addition of hydrogen serves to extend the useful li fe of the nickel reactant. The hydrogen can be derived from source of  pure hydrogen gas, a recycl e gas stream, or can be derived from an electrolysis cell which breaks down water produced in the fuel cell  into its hydrogen and oxygen components. The hydrogen when added to the fuel stock serves to prevent or minimize carbon formation  of the nickel reactant bed, thereby extending the useful life of the reactant bed, since carbon deposits tend to block active sites in the  reactant bed.

The guar  seed contains 30-35% galactomannan located in endosperm (also called refined guar gum split) that contains 30-35% galactomannan  gum. Refined guar gum powder has various food and industrial applications. Processing of guar seed is aimed to get endosperm free  of germ and hull. The conventional process involves splitting the seed, separation of germ, dehulling, separation of hull, and grinding  of the endosperm to different sizes and refining of the gum powder. Splitting and dehulling of the seed is done by two processes i.e.  dry grinding and wet milling. In the present invention, a pretreatment for guar seed is developed for its easy dehulling and better  recovery of endosperm (refined guar gum splits). In the pretreatment process the guar seed is submerged into a food grade solvent  (chemical A) at a speci fied temperature for a predetermined, relatively short duration. The excess solvent is drained from the sample  immediately and the solvent present on the surface of the seed is removed. Then the seed is immediately fed to specially designed  double roll dehulling system where dehulling of the pretreated guar seed is done. The hull is removed from the dehulled lot using  aspirator. The dehulled and unhulled seeds are separated using conventional grader. Dehulled seeds are dried using hot air to bring  moisture content to 10% (dry basis). Dehulled seeds are then split in to two halves using burr mill. Polishing of the splits removes  traces of germ from cotyledon. The refined guar gum splits thus obtained are separat ed using grader.      '

The bicycle for carrying goods demand difference in support design as compared to  bicycle basically meant for sel f travel. The carrier to a bicycle for carrying humans has to be different from the carrier required for  holding and supporting heavy goods. The adjustment of the load on the vehicle should be such that the unbalanced twisting moment  produced on the handle of the cycle remains to a minimum. If the goods carri er on the bicycle exerts its force on bicycle body at a  point which is close to the ground-overall centre of gravity of the loaded vehicle would be closer to the ground - resulting into better  stability. The basic design of bicycle needs has been re analysed and changed to accommodate the loads - LPG cylinders etc in a more  balanced way such that the driver does not feel discomfort during driving. Following have been accomplished in the present invention;  i) Attachment for Bicycle frames of conventional design for improved performance. ii) Attachment for load carrier support for  carrying goods - such that the load comes directly on the spindle-close to the rear wheel axis- with reduced possibility of hub failure  and better load balancing on handle. An improved bicycle has been developed with following features: a) The carrier load acting on  the rear spindle has been readjusted through a suitable attachment to the bicycle frame of conventional design -such that the rolling  resistance reduces and in turn the wear on the rolling element in the cup - ball - spindle combination minimizes resulting into longer  maintenance free life. b) The support point of the load on the bicycle carrier has been redesigned. In a special design for transporting  LPG cylinders- the cylinder rests on the L shaped carri er projection - extended below the wheel centre point such that the load coming  on the carrier from the top most hinge point reduces considerably resulting into a better stability & less unbalanced forces on the  handle.

Control circuit under no load condition helps to set the output voltage close to the voltage rating of zener diodes used at the  output terminals of series pass transistors. Series pass transistors acts as a switch and remain in off condition when load gets  disconnected from intrinsically safe power supply unit. In this situation resistor connected across series pass transistors provides small  current to control circuit to maintain preset voltage at the output terminal. Under no load condition zener diodes plays a role to  maintain preset voltage at the output terminal during increase in unregulated input voltage occurring owing to the fluctuations in main  supply. Moreover, series pass transistors capable of dissipating sufficient heat without damage serves the purpose of maintaining  preset voltage at its output terminals when unregulated input voltage increases owing to the fluctuations in main supply voltage. As a  result current limiting resistor provided at the output end of series pass transistors can safely be used for providing high current to load  within the range of variations of the main power supply. It also provides means to monitor over current condition in the circuit. The  power supply unit of the present invention restricts current flow to external fault. To add more safety output voltage is limited further  by zener diodes and fuse in the event of failure of seri es pass transistors.      '

The process uses high intensity near infrared  radiation in pulsed mode along with air blast, which rapidly heats the kernels resulting in reduced processing time. The above process  results in improved product quality in terms of color, texture and sensorial characteristics, as compared to drum roasting. The rapid  heating of kernels with IR causes higher degree of cell disruption, resulting in higher oil recovery from the roasted kernels. Due to  reduced processing time and rapid reduction in moisture content, the development of oxidation products (peroxides) and FFA during  processing is minimized. The above process provides a continuous process for roasting and is easy to scale up.     '

The Following points need consideration: a)  The tank outer surface should absorb minimum solar radiation such that the energy transfer to the tank water from the outer surface  gets minimized. b) The tank top portion should be provided with openings in the form of vent space for accumulat ed hot gases to  escape. For the above needs - following have been done in the present invention: Applying environment friendly techniques -on the  molded plastic tanks of existing design -leading to a surface that reflects and reduces solar radiation absorption. The above  requirements have been achieved through: i) Permanent coating on the outer surface by a suitable material. ii)Temporary cladding or  sheath on outer surface with a suitable material that reflects solar radiation. The air trapped inside the tank - above the water level that  comes in direct contact with the water- should be provided with an escape route -such that the hot - less dense air moves up and  escapes through a suitable size opening provided at the top of the tank. For this the provision of air vent holes on cover - along with  fl aps and net has been made - and this helps in maintaining air temperature inside tank equivalent to atmospheric level.      '

The different opening positions introduce the feedstock across a larger area of the cross-section of the riser, which may  improve the feedstock dispersion and mixing with catalyst. Improved mixing may increase conversion of the feedstock. Larger FCC  units generally have greater riser diameters (D) that may cause problems for feedstock dispersion and decrease the ability for the  feedstock to mix with catalyst. Injecting the feedstock at multiple radial positions may improve feedstock dispersion in larger FCC  units and increase mixing.     '
