In particular, the present invention relates to a container which can be readily transported on aircraft, such as an aircraft container. In the field of logistics, that is the field of movement and supply of produce and materials, in particular in the transport of intermediate and finished products, containers have been developed which safely protect from physical damage a wide variety of product. Food and pharmaceutical products not only need protection from physical shock and pressures but also require temperature stability during transportation; otherwise goods can be damaged and be unusable, whether such damage is apparent or not. However, air transport poses a particular problem: Goods can be transported in tropical heat, packaged and placed upon pallets and the like containers whereby they are presented in aircraft style containers. Such goods may be left on runways at extreme temperatures (+40° C) and then placed within a hold where low pressures and low temperatures exist during flight. At a destination airport the temperatures may well be sub-zero. To simplify transport with respect to airports, planes and handling equipment, there have been developed aircraft Unit Load Devices (ULDs) which comprise any type of pallet or container that can easily be loaded to the aircraft by a ground handler. The present invention seeks to provide a transport container which can maintain goods within a narrow temperature range, can displace a considerably reduced volume before erection, is economical to manufacture, can readily and easily be constructed. The present invention further seeks to provide a transport container which is compatible with standard Unit Load Device specifications. ",

Daidzein of the structure 1 and daidzin of the structure 2 reduce palmitate stimulated increased synthesis of NF-kB significantly. Daidzein inhibits formation of NF- kB -DNA complex stimulated by palmitate and both daidzein and daidzin inhibited NF- kB expression which leads to reduction of its DNA binding. Daidzein of the structure 1 was obtained from soy leaves through chromatography and both natural and synthetic daidzein and daidzin have same biological activities. ",

Each exhaust-system collecting branch (5, 6) can be shut off completely during an engine braking operation by a shutoff member (10, 11). Furthermore, a bypass line (14, 15) which can be controlled for opening and closing by a control member (12, 13) branches off from the region of each exhaust-system collecting branch (5, 6) which can be shut off, the end region of which line, which is formed in a turbine casing wall (16) in the manner of a nozzle bore (14, 15), directed at least approximately tangentially on to the outer region of the turbine wheel (17), opens into the turbine chamber (18).

The three dimensional video image and the microwave image are converted into a general system of coordinates. The distance Z1 between the microwave radiation source and the reflector that is free of the dielectric object, and the distance Z2 between the microwave radiation source and the section of the microwave image of the reflector in the region of the dielectric object are calculated. On the basis of the video image, the distance Z3 between the microwave radiation source and the video image of the dielectric object is determined in the general system of coordinates. The dielectric permittivity of the dielectric object is then determined from the relationship: (I). The invention makes it possible to remotely determine the dielectric permittivity of a moving, irregularly-shaped dielectric object. ",

Surveys say that 14 people die every hour in India due to road accidents. And the fact to be given attention is that 60% of road accidents happen at night due to lack of visual perception of traffic sign boards. There is no effective system to put a check on this increasing accident rate. Even if the driver is alert, due to lack of visual clearance during night time, he/she happens to oversee the traffic sign boards and meet with catastrophic accidents. To address the problem, an attempt has been made to produce an embedded system that will armounce the traffic sign board inside the vehicle 30m even before the sign board will arrive. So the driver gets sufficient time to drive carefully. The system is ELECTRONIC TRAFFIC SIGN BOARD ANNOUNCER IN VEHICLES USING RADIO FREQUENCY SIGNALS. It is the design and implementation of a low cost embedded system in vehicles and traffic sign boards, to alarm the driver about the traffic sign boards on road, which otherwise would otherwise go urmoticed at night time due to lack of vision.

The hollow housing is, at inside, formed with a second chamber, and is provided with an opening and an air outlet. The outlet tube is connected with the air outlet of the hollow housing. The filter assembly is fastened to the opening of the hollow housing. The casing is provided with an air inlet, and is fastened to the hollow housing so as to form a first chamber. The inlet tube is connected to the air inlet of the casing. As such, the air outlet and the air inlet are arranged separately in the hollow housing and the casing. Since there is no need to retain an arranging space for the inlet tube, the space of the second chamber where the air outlet is located can be increased. This will overcome the defect of the conventional art which has a smaller dimension for the chamber where the air outlet is located, causing an insufficient intake when a prompt intake is required, and adversely affecting performance of the engine.

The exhaust gas treatment system includes a control module that monitors operation of the internal combustion engine for an amount of fuel consumed and an amount of oil consumed by the internal combustion engine. The control module includes a sulfur adsorption module and a total sulfur storage module. The sulfur adsorption module determines a rate of sulfur adsorption in at least one aftertreatment device. The rate of sulfur adsorption is based on the amount of fuel consumed and the amount of oil consumed. The total sulfur storage module is in communication with the sulfur adsorption module. The total sulfur storage module determines the total amount of sulfur stored based on the rate of sulfur adsorption. ",
