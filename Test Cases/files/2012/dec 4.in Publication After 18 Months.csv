The invention also provides a method for the development  of such EMI shielding materials using a novel dispersion technique for higher loading of CNTs. This technique enables up to 50 wt%  of CNTs to be uniformly dispersed in the polymer. Such high loadings result in achieving high EMI shielding effectiveness of up to 80  to 105 dB in X-band (8.2-12.4 GHz) and Ku-band (12.4-18 GHz). These composite primarily behave as EMI shielding material  making them available as shielding materials for a variety of applications such as radar absorption material and for shielding of  electronic equipments, medical instruments etc. In addition to having high EMI shielding properties, these composites are strong, light  weight (density in the range 1.2-1.3 g/cc), flexible and corrosion resistant. This makes these CNT-polymer composites more  advantageous than metals and other carbon-based polymer composite materials as EMI shielding materials in range 8.2-18 GHz  covering X and Ku band of the electromagnetic spectra.

However, it has been difficult to obtain these cells because the frequency of MSCs in UCB is extremely rare (0.4 -30  out of 1 X 10 mononuclear cells). To date, the isolation of MSCs has depended upon their plastic-adhesion capacity. Some true MSCs  could be missed because their ability to adhere to plastic may be poor.

Per se, woollen garments require an intermediate garment made of cotton or other fibres next to  the skin to avoid direct contact with the sensitive human skin to avoid itching when worn. Prickling due to woollen garments is mainly  attributed to the small percentage of coarse fibres present in the yarn, which apply some force on the skin without bucking. Itching is  the combination of this pricking effect and the friction between wool fibre and skin. The surface sharp scales present on the wool  fibres, when comes in contact with skin, cause friction between garment and body. These two effects in combination make the  woollen garments uncomfortable, when worn next to skin. In this invention prickling force and the friction of fibre with human skin  were minimize or eliminated using plasma/ enzyme/other degradative processes/ polymer and softener treatments on the knitwears.  User trials confirmed that, the knitwears so prepared are completely itch free.    ",

VARUN SATYADEVJI GOUD   ","  Wool is a natural fibre which in raw form comprises nearly 30% of its weight by contaminants. These impurities need to be removed  before any further processing. This is done by scouring the wool. The conventional methods of wool scouring utilize high amount of  chemicals, detergent, alkali etc which create some serious problems; both, for the environment and the industry during effluent  treatment and disposal. These drawbacks of the existing scouring process have been addressed time and again with the development in  newer technologies; however most of the technologies have not been successful. This invention presents an improved method for  scouring of raw greasy wool with the help of ultrasound technology. According to the present invention, the scouring efficiency of raw  wool significantly increases when ultrasonic irradiations generated by immersible type tube resonators are introduced in to the  scouring bowl. The tube resonators create compression and rarefaction waves in the liquid medium. During the rarefaction phase of  the wave, the liquid molecules are stretched apart leading to formation of millions of microscopic bubbles which implode as the  compression wave reaches towards them. These implosions liberate vast amount of energy in the form of micro-jets (micro streaming)  of liquid. When these micro-jets collide with the wool fibre surface, they take away even the tightly bound impurities from the fibres.  This mechanical energy of imploding cavities creates a micro-brushing sort of an action and accelerates the cleaning action of  chemicals like detergent and alkali. Hence, the scouring temperature, time and consumption of chemicals can be reduced with  ultrasound assisted scouring. Moreover, the whiteness and bulkiness of the ultrasonically scoured wool also get improved alongwith  reduced entangling of fibres.     ",

Some embodiments of the present invention provide a method and system for establishing real estate units (RU) representative of the  value of real property assets. The system includes a central server accessible via a network having a processor, software, random  memory, and data storage hardware. The data storage hardware stores a database having data pertaining to a plurality of real estate  assets and transforms the data to unitize real estate units reflective of the value by classifying the real estate assets into asset classes.  Transformed data includes a saleable area of each property and an initial price for the real estate units based on the asset classes and  saleable area. Accordingly, the server enables trading of the real estate units via the network.

The  floating, swelling controlled release gastroretentive drug delivery system of an active pharmaceutical ingredient that has a Narrow  Absorption Window in the upper part of the small intestine or drugs that act locally in the stomach. The drug delivery system consists  of a synergistic double matrix system. The polymer and the meltable binder are present in an optimized ratio to provide the required  floating and controlled release profile that renders a once a day oral dosage form of the active pharmaceutical ingredient incorporated  into the matrix. Carbomer is used as the matrix forming agent and Cetostearyl Alcohol as the meltable binder. Different ratios between  cetostearyl alcohol and carbomer are also used to achieve optimal gastric retention and desired controlled release profile. The ratio  between the swellable matrix and the meltable binder matrix (Carbomer: Cetostearyl Alcohol) in the three formulation is 12.5:87.5,  9.5: 90.5, 6.5:93.5. The drug is first embedded / predispersed in the swellable polymer by mixing the drug with the swellable polymer.  This highly swellable polymer matrix can be melted by the application of external heat and the dosage form can be produced by  melted agglomeration/granulation without using organic solvent in the production of the granules. The granules are then screened,  lubricated and compressed into tablets. The composition and process is effective, economical and ecofriendly.    ",
