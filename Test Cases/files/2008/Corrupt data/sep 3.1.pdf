(57) Abstract : 
A unique method and apparatus modifies the load impedance at the output of a power amplifier by varying a voltage variable 
capacitor (VVC) (310) to maximize the effi ciency of the power amplifier (304). A comparator (509) generat es amplifier control signal 
(211) based upon a detected power output signal (216) and a reference signal. In addition to providing power control, the control 
signal is also coupled to a VVC circuit (506) to control the output impedance of the power amplifier. In an alternate embodiment, a 
separate VVC control signal (527) based upon a comparison of the power control signal and the battery voltage is coupled to a VVC. 
In another alternate embodiment, a second VVC can be coupled in parallel to the first VVC. The second VVC is preferably controlled 
by a signal (805) based upon the current in the power amplifier. Finally, an alternate embodiment incorporates a VVC circuit (506) at 
the input of the power amplifier to compensate for variations in input impedance to improve other power amplifier parameters such as 
IM, gain, output power and noise level.

(57) Abstract : 
An apparatus and a process for filling a plural chamber container, such as a container, with plural flow able materials. The container 
might be a two-compartment denti frice container or a two-compartment adhesive container, for example. The container has internal 
partitioning dividing it into plural chambers, and the partitioning must be properly positioned to permit supply nozzles to enter the 
respective chambers. In one embodiment, the partitioning is positioned by probes which are inserted into the chamber, following 
which relative rotation between the container and the probes causes the probes to position the partitioning. In a second embodiment, 
air nozzles emit air jets to position the partition. In another embodiment, an electrostatic charge is induced on the container sidewall 
and on the partition, and the like charges cause the sidewall and the partition to repel each other, positioning the partition. In a further 
embodiment, an air/vacuum nozzle is inserted into one of the container chambers, and air jets and suction are alternated to position the 
partition so that a supply nozzle can be inserted into each chamber of the container.

(57) Abstract : 
In a process for the production of liquid pig iron (43) or liquid steel pre-products from charging substances comprising iron, ore (5) 
and fluxes and at least partially containing a portion of fines, the iron ore is directly reduced to sponge iron in at least two reduction 
stages (1, 2) by the fluidized bed method, the sponge iron is melted in a melt-down gasifying zone (39) under the supply of carbon 
carriers and an oxygen-containing gas, and a CO- and H2-containing reducing gas is produced which is injected into reduction zones 
of the reduction stages (1,2), is reacted there, is withdrawn as a top gas and optionally is supplied to a consumer. To achieve uniform 
reduction of the iron ore at optimum exploitation of the reducing gas,  the iron ore (5) in a first reduction stage (1) by aid of the 
reducing gas is fractionated into at least two fractions having different grain size distributions each,  each fraction is reduced by the 
reducing gas in a separate fluidized bed (6, 15),  wherein the reducing gas maintains a first fluidized bed (6) containing the coarse-
grain fraction and separates the fine-grain fraction from the same, and wherein, further, reducing gas is additionally introduced into the 
further fluidized bed (15) directly  reduced iron ore (5) is discharged both from the first and from the further fluidized bed (6, 15)and  
the fine- and the coarse-grain fraction reduced in the first reduction stage (1) are further reduced in at least one further reduction stage 
(2) operating in the same manner as the first reduction stage (1) and from the last reduction stage (2) the fine-grain fraction is 
introduced into the melt-down gasifying zone (39) while being agglomerated by provision of oxygen, and the coarse-grain fraction is 
fed directly into the melt-down gasifying zone (39) gravitationally .

(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for channel hopping between mobile stations (MS1-MS3) and a base station (BS1) in 
a radio communications system. A channel allocation means (211) within the base station (BSD generates channel hopping sequences 
that are transmitted via a control channel (SACCH) to hopping sequence lists (204-206) in the mobile stations (MS1-MS3) . The 
hopping sequences are also transmitted to corresponding hopping sequence lists (201-203) in the base station (BSD . A channel 
hopping sequence is divided into a number of sequence intervals (TA) corresponding to the time between two adjacent channel hops 
within a channel hopping sequence. In the channel allocation means (211) the attenuation (5) of the connections (F1-F3) and the 
interference (I (channel)) of the channels are continuously being observed within each sequence interval (Tt) . The channel allocation 
means (211) generates channel hopping sequences according to the principle that a connection that has poor connection quality will be 
allocated a channel hopping sequence with channels of high channel quality and connections with successively better connection 
quality are allocated channel hopping sequence having successively poorer channels.

(57) Abstract : 
A method and an apparatus for increasing the spatial resolution and sensitivity of a color flow image while maintaining a desired 
acoustic frame rate. The ultrasound energy is concentrated at a more narrowly defined focal region, which allows for increased flow 
sensitivity and vessel filling. Better flow uniformity across the color region of interest is also achieved. The method uses multiple 
transmit focal zones, and transmit and receive apertures having low f-numbers. Using multiple focal zones with low f-numbers allows 
for tight focusing over a larger depth-of-fi eld. Unique waveforms and unique gain curves are used for each focal zone. Each focal 
zone is fired on a separate acoustic frame. An adaptive frame averaging algorithm is used to blend together the in-focus data from 
each of these acoustic frames before the data is displayed.

(57) Abstract : 
A direct sequence spread spect rum receiver samples an incoming signal and stores the sample in memory. Prior to sampling and 
storage, the incoming signal is translated to an IF signal. Also prior to storage, the IF signal is correct ed for a frequency offset signal. 
The frequency offset may be caused by many sources, Ooppler shift or local oscillator error, for example. Once the signal is corrected 
for the frequency offset, the signal sample is stored in memory. The signal sample is read from memory as necessary to process  the 
signal. Such a receiver is useful in global positioning satellite (GPS) signal processing where the incoming signal contains several 
satellite transmissions encoded with CDMA encoding.

(57) Abstract : 
A direct sequence spread spect rum receiver samples an incoming signal and stores the sample in memory. The signal sample is read 
from memory as necessary to process the signal without further signal acquisition. The correlator calcul ates an inner product by 
simultaneously correlating each bit of the sample with a corresponding bit of a replica signal. If the inner product does not exceed a 
threshold value the correlator calculates another inner product between the same signal sample and another replica signal. This occurs 
until all available signals are identified. In one embodiment, memory is segmented and each segment is read by a separate correlator 
allowing faster identifi cation of one signal or multiple signals to be acquired simultaneously. Such a receiver is useful in global 
positioning satellite (GPS) signal processing where the incoming signal contains several satellite transmissions encoded with COMA 
encoding.

(57) Abstract : 
Present invention provides a method for producing hot CO- and 112-containing reducing gas utilized for the reduction of lumpy metal 
ore, in particular iron ore, which comprises forming the reducing gas in a gasification zone by the gasifi cation of carbon carriers, in 
particular coal, taking place in the presence of a supply of oxygen and subsequently cooling the reducing gas down to a reducing-gas 
temperature favorable to the reduction process, wherein H2O and/or CO2 is added to a reducing gas which has been subjected to a 
cooling operation that docs not effect an addition of H2O/CO2 in order to prevent the Boudouard and heterogeneous water-gas 
reaction and a resultant heating of the reducing gas, wherein the reducing gas is converted to a reducing gas that is thermodynamically 
more stable at the reducing-gas temperature.

(57) Abstract : 
A determination can be made of how changes to underlying data affect the value of objects. Examples of applications include: caching 
dynamic Web pages; client-server applications whereby a server sending objects (which are changing all the time) to multiple clients 
can track which versions are sent to which clients and how obsolete the versions are; and any situation where it is necessary to 
maintain and uniquely identify several versions of objects, update obsolete objects, quantitatively assess how different two vers ions of 
the same object are, and/or maintain consistency among a set of objects. A directed graph, called an object dependence graph, may be 
used to represent the data dependencies between objects. Another aspect is constructing and maintaining objects to associate changes 
in remote data with cached objects. If data in a remote data source changes, database change notifications are used to "trigger" a 
dynamic rebuild of associat ed objects. Thus, obsolete objects can be dynamically replaced with fresh objects. The objects can be 
complex objects, such as dynamic Web pages or compound-complex objects, and the data can be underlying data in a database. The 
update can include either: storing a new version of the object in the cache; or deleting an object from the cache. Caches on multiple 
servers can also be synchronized with the data in a single common database. Updated information, whether new pages or delete 
orders, can be broadcast to a set of server nodes, permitting many systems to simultaneously benefit from the advantages of perfecting 
and providing a high degree of scal eability.

(57) Abstract : 
A process for producing mixed refrigerants comprises selecting the order of introduction of refrigerant components (groups) so that 
the liquid density of the refrigerant component (group) to be introduced afterwards is lower at the introduction temperature than the 
density of the liquid phase of the refrigerant component (group) already introduced into the vessel, or for speci fic 3-component 
systems, introducing the first 2 components in descending order of density and selecting the vapor pressure of the final component so 
as to be higher than the vapor pressure of liquid phase of the component group already introduced into the vessel, with the refrigerant 
component to be introduced afterwards being introduced into the liquid phase of the already introduced refrigerant component (group). 
It is thus possible to rapidly and effi ciently produce mixed refrigerants with uniform compositions by a simple admixture of different 
types of refrigerant components in a tank or steel cylinder.

(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method of obtaining a copy protected optical record carrier carrying information in different blocks, a 
method of accessing such a copy protected optical record carrier and such an optical record carrier itsel f. Access means for opti cal 
record carriers return di fferent results when retrieving blocks, which contain incorrect address data in the corresponding subcode 
fi elds. A copy protection key will be implemented during manufacture of an optical record carrier by modifying the subcode address 
information of a predetermined pattern of blocks. It is normally not possible to copy incorrect address data onto an optical record 
carrier, since the address data will be newly generated during the copy process. Therefore, such a key can be utilized to distinguish 
between an original disc and a copied or non original disc. The key is preset before manufacturing of the optical record carrier itself 
and can therefore be used to encrypt the data stored on the optical record carrier. Upon accessing of the data, first the key is extracted 
from the optical record carrier and then the data can be decrypted utilizing this key.

(57) Abstract : 
The housing is heated or cooled to adjust its diameter and, in particular, the play between the tips of the rotor blades and the housing. 
The apparatus consists of networks of tubes (1) covering complementary portions of the circumference of the housing and consisting 
of a pair of distributors (3) and parallel tubes (2) between said distributors, said tubes (2) being alternately connected to one or other of 
the distributors and provided with apertures to blow the gas onto the housing. The counter-flow circul ation in the tubes (2) makes it 
possible to supply both gas that has been greatly heated by traveling a considerable distance through the tubes (2) and cooler gas that 
has traveled less far in other tubes (2) to any point on the housing, thereby balancing out the heat applied to every portion of the 
housing.

(57) Abstract : 
An improved method and apparatus is disclosed for removing condensable materi al from a gas. The gas is caused to flow in series 
through a chiller for cooling the gas and condensing the condensable material from the gas, then through a separator to separate the 
condensate from the gas, and then passing the gas through a reheater to reheat the gas. A predetermined charge of refrigerant is passed 
in a closed cycle through the chiller to cool the gas by absorbing the heat from the gas and evaporating, then the gaseous refrigerant is 
compressed by a compression unit having an electric drive means in which an amount of energy is added to the gaseous refrigerant. 
The hot, pressurized, gaseous refrigerant is then passed through an auxiliary condenser sized to remove the energy that was added to 
the refrigerant by the compression unit at no load conditions, then the refrigerant is passed through the reheater to further condense the 
refrigerant and to transfer heat to the exiting gas. The refrigerant then exits the reheater and returns to the chiller, completing the 
closed cycle. The predetermined charge of refrigerant is sized to cause the refrigerant exiting the reheat er to be in a substantially 
gaseous state when there is no flow of gas through the reheater and to cause the pressure of the refrigerant exiting the reheater to 
generally decrease as the flow of gas through the reheater increases.

(57) Abstract : 
A method of commissioning an internal combustion engine controlled by an electronic engine control unit (ECU) is described. The 
method of commissioning includes an engine mapping function in which the engine is mapped at a combination of speeds and loads to 
build up a full set of engine operating parameters which are known collectively as the engine control set (ECS). The method includes 
defining a speed/load mapping table and generating a graphical display of a corresponding speed/load grid (20) having a plurality of 
cells arranged in a grid, each cell corresponding to a particular speed/load combination in the speed/load mapping table. The engine is 
driven as close as possible to a selected speed/load combination (24) and the value of a select ed engine operating parameter is adjusted 
to obtain an optimum value at the selected speed/load combination. Each unmapped cell in the grid is displayed in a first visually 
distinct manner and each mapped cell is displayed in a second visually distinct manner. One cell (22) in the speed/load grid is 
displayed in a third visually distinct manner to indicate the engine's current operating position. The method of commissioning may 
optionally provide for automatic balancing of exhaust temperatures for each cylinder of the engine.

(57) Abstract : 
A method of fabricating scintillators using a inside diameter saw is described. The inner diameter saw includes a blade having a 
diamond coated inner circumference cutting edge. In one embodiment, a plurality of scintillators are stacked and cut with the ID saw 
to form a plurality of first bars. The first bars are placed in a fixture creating a gap which is filled with a cast reflector material. The 
first bars are then cut with the ID saw at a 90 degree angle to the pieces creating second bars. The second bars are placed in a fi xture 
and spaced to create second gaps similar to the first gaps. The second gaps are filled similar to the first gaps with a cast reflector 
material forming scintillator array. The described method minimizes the number of handling operations, therefore saving time.

(57) Abstract : 
A cardiac segmentation system acquires a series of images acquires as slices through a volume, and as images at different time periods 
throughout a cardiac cycle. It displays an image to an operator which interactively selects a region of interest (ROI) of the image to be 
segmented, such as the left ventricle. A seed point is also selected within the ROI and the structure desired to be segmented. The 
image is then threshold by a masking device classi fying points within the ROI as above the threshold, or not above the threshold. A 
3D connectivity device identifi es points within the ROI having the same classification as an expanded seed point which is also 
contiguous with the seed point as the segmented structure. The segmented structure is expanded and a histogram is constructed. A new 
threshold is selected which separates modes of the histogram, and used to carry out a revised, final, segmentation of the current image. 
The centroid of the current image is used as a seed point in segmenting adjacent images. Similarly, the current threshold is used as an 
initial threshold for adjacent images. The previous seed point and ROI may also be used. This is repeated for a number of images to 
result in segmented structures may then be stored, displayed and used in calculating heart functionality.

(57) Abstract : 
Polynuclear aromatic compounds (PNA's) produced as a by-product in a hydrocarbon dehydrogenation zone are removed and 
recovered by admixing the effluent from the dehydrogenation zone with a recycle stream containing mononuclear aromatic 
compounds (MNA's) and the resulting admixture is contacted with an adsorbent to reduce the concentration of MNA's and PNA's and 
to produce a stream comprising dehydrogenated hydrocarbons and dehydrogenatable hydrocarbons. The spent adsorbent recovered 
from the adsorption step containing MNA's and PNA's is regenerated by contacting with a hot hydrogen-rich gas to recover at least a 
portion of the MNA's and PNA's and to thereby regenerate the spent adsorbent. The hydrocarbon-containing effluent from the 
regeneration step is then separated into a MNA's -containing stream and a PNA's-containing stream and at least a portion of the 
MNA's-containing stream is recycled to the mixing step.

(57) Abstract : 
A method for producing pulsed-voltage sequences for the operation of discharge lamps (8) by means of a pulsed discharge which is 
impeded dielectrically provides that the pulsed-voltage sequence is composed of two partial voltage sequences in such a manner that 
the magnitudes of the peak values of each partial voltage sequence are less than the magnitudes of the peak values of the resultant 
pulsed-voltage sequence, for example hal f as large. This has the advantage that correspondingly less EMI is generated when the 
partial-voltage sequences are produced. In addition, the two partial voltage sequences contain rising flanks of opposite gradient with 
respect to a reference-earth potential, the two partial voltage sequences preferably being inverted with respect to one another. This 
provides ideal complete compensation for the electromagnetic interference (EMI) produced by the two partial voltage sequences, at 
least locally. A circuit arrangement for this purpose provides two pulse circuits (1; 2) which are connected in series and are 
synchronized with the aid of a timer circuit (3).

(57) Abstract : 
The instant invention provides a method for causing a plurality of printer systems to perform parallel printing operation by a computer 
in a network. When a request for printing a document is to be output to printers, a document monitoring process is performed for each 
document. In the document monitoring process, the conditions of the currently available printer resources are examined, and for 
optimal performance of the printing request, a document to be printed is divided into a plurality of printing jobs. The division of the 
document into a plurality of printing jobs can cope with various requests for optimization, such as a reduction in turn-around time. The 
printing job is a program for managing the printing of each page, such as printing "from page x to page y" of a document, and 
monitors the performance of the document printing process. By using this program, a different procedure can be employed for each 
printing job. When the printer monitor receives a printing job agent, a program defined in the printing job agent is changed to an 
executable form by the printer monitor. When no malfunction occurs at the printer, the program of the printing job agent initiates the 
printing of a designated document, and then notifies the source that the printing has completed normally.

(57) Abstract : 
In a nutating machine such as a high intensity comminution machine having a nutating drum (1), a support bearing is provided by 
pairs of rolling bearing surfaces 6 and 8, and 7 and 9. In order to reduce power requirements and wear each pair of complementary 
contact paths traced our by the bearing surface pairs has an equal ratio of path length in the stationary bearing surface (8,9) to the path 
length in the nutating bearing surface (6,7) . In one embodiment, irrigational movement of the nutating element is achieved by having 
equal path lengths as between the stationary bearing surface and the nutating bearing surface in both pairs.

(57) Abstract : 
This invention relates to a line fault locator for fault-distance determination on HVDC line wherein two or more HVDC lines (2a, 2b) 
are connected in parallel, based on measurement of the traveling waves which, at a fault (F), propagate from the fault on the parallel 
connect ed lines in separate directions towards the two stations of the lines and where the fault-distance determination is performed by 
determining the difference in time, via synchronous clocks, is obtained between the times of the traveling waives reaching the two 
stations, characterized in that the line fault locator comprises dc instrument transformers (5, 6) for measuring the current which is 
associated with the traveling waves, detecting the current at the two stations and on each one of the parallel-connected lines, a filter 
identifies the current which is associated with the traveling wave and have a frequency above a curt ain preset value such that only 
signals from the shunt resistance and each DCCT are detected by a detector for further evaluation of the fault distance.

(57) Abstract : 
In a method for detecting the state of dialling a code number a number of already dialled digits (Nx) is counted and is compared with a 
defined number of digits to be dialled. If this number is reached, a timer (Tx) is started and during the runtime of the timer it is 
detected whether further digits are dialled. If further digits are dialled the timer is restated at every detection. If no further digit is 
detected, after time out of the timer a query is launched. Alternatively aft er launching a first query it is possible to analyse the already 
dialed number of digits and to define a number of digits to be dialed. If then this number is reached a timer is started and the further 
method is processed.

aqueous broth and the second receptacle contains an aqueous broth including a carbon source. The method then includes placing into 
the first receptacle a first support surface having a paraffin wax coating thereon and placing into the second receptacl e a second 
support surface having a hydrophobia materi al coating thereon. A body specimen, such as sputum, is then introduced into each of the 
first and second receptacles. The presence of a nonparaffinophilic hydrophobic microorganism in the body specimen is determined by 
observing (i) a lack of microorganism growth on the paraffin coated materi al of the first support surface and (ii) a presence of 
microorganism growth on the hydrophobic material coating of the second support surface. An associated kit is also disclosed.

(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to a hinge mechanism which provides a tight sound guide joint in a sound guide (13) which is split 
between a communication unit (11) and a foldable flip part (12) . At least two shaft elements (21, 22) pivotally connect the flip part to 
the communication unit. Each shaft element is arranged in a respective pivot point (26, 27) for the flip part along the pivot axis (25) of 
the flip part. The sound guide joint is arranged in a first pivot point (26) for the flip part between an opposing surface on the flip part 
and an opposing surface on the communication unit. The sound guide parts (13a, 13b) are thereby connected to each other irrespective 
of which pivot position the flip part takes up relative to the communication unit. The hinge mechanism comprises at least one 
compressive resilient element (32) , which, via a shaft element (22) in a second pivot point (27), exerts a force on the two opposing 
surfaces so that the sound guide joint is pressed together and becomes sound-tight.

(57) Abstract : 
In the data communication method in which the data frame transmitted from the transmission side to the reception side and the 
feedback frame transmitted from the reception side to the transmission side use a common format jointly, to propose a data 
communication method in which if there is no substantial data to be transported by the feedback frame on the reception side, the 
feedback frame is transmitted from the reception side to the transmission side without changing the format of the feedback frame and 
lowering the reception rate. In the data communication, the common format includes at least each data of the transmission data length, 
the transmission data, the data frame number and the repeat request frame number, and is added with the error detection code for the 
entirety of the data. If there is no substantial transmission data to be transported by the feedback frame on the reception side, then the 
feedback frame is arranged such that data unrelated to feedback information including at least the transmission data length, the 
transmission data and the data frame number within the feedback frame, are substituted with the predetermined fixed pattern, and 
thereafter an error detecting code for the entirety of the data is added thereto. Then, the feedback frame is transmitted from the 
reception side to the transmission side.

(57) Abstract : 
Protein isolates having a high protein content, and low residual fat content are provided in substantially non-denatured form by 
extracting an oil seed meal having a significant fat content, particularly canola meal, with an aqueous food grade salt solution to cause 
solubilization of protein and fat in the oil seed meal and form an aqueous protein solution. Fat is removed from the aqueous protein 
solution by chilling the aqueous protein solution and removing the fat which separates. The protein concentration of the defatted 
protein solution is increased while the ionic strength is maintained substantially constant. A further fat removal operation may be 
carried out on the concentrated protein solution followed by dilution to an ionic strength below about 0.2 to cause the formation of 
discrete protein particles in the aqueous phase in the form of protein micelles. These protein micelles are settled to form a mass of 
aggregated protein isolate in the form of an amorphous, sticky gelatinous, gluten-like protein micellar mass, which is separated from 
the supernatant and dried to a proteinaceous powder.

(57) Abstract : 
It is intended to provide a swash plate type continuously variable transmission capable of automatically affording a lock-up state in 
which second distributing valves are stopped at their stroke mid-point to cut off motor ports when a motor swash plate stands upright, 
even without using any special interlocking mechanism. Second distributing valves for bringing motor ports of motor cylinder bores 
into communication with a high-pressure oil path and a low-pressure oil path selectively in an alternate manner are arranged in parallel 
with the axis X of a cylinder block; a valve swash plate for reciprocating the second distributing valves is integrally combined with a 
motor swash plate on the same slant plane; and the motor ports are formed so as to be controlled selectively by the second distributing 
valves at respective positions 90° out of phase in the in circumferential direction of the cylinder block 4 with respect to the 
corresponding motor cylinder bores, the second distributing valves being stopped at their stroke mid-points when the motor swash 
plate stands upright. In a swash plate type hydraulic unit for use as a swash plate type oil-hydraulic pump or motor, it is intended to 
attain the reduction in redial size of the hydraulic unit while ensuring a suffi cient plunger stroke.

(57) Abstract : 
Subscription-based information in a mobile telecommunications system is utilized to control idle mode operations of a mobile station. 
In one aspect, cell-rel ated information is broadcast from cells. A mobile station then uses the received cell-rel ated information to 
determine whether any given cell is part of a predefined service area that is reserved for use by only certain subscribers to the 
exclusion of other subscribers. The cell-related information may be a cell identifier that uniquely identifies a corresponding cell, or it 
may alternatively be a service area identifier that uniquely identifies a service area that comprises one or more cells. In either case, the 
mobile terminal makes its determination by accessing a memory such as a Subscriber Information Module (SIM), and retrieving 
therefrom stored information that defines the predefined service areas. In another aspect, the SIM may store information identi fying 
preferred cells for the mobile station to camp on during idle mode.

(57) Abstract : 
In a gas-fueled internal combustion engine, an ignition device is arranged in a moving direction of a stream of the gaseous fuel 
injected from an in-cylinder injection valve in a combustion chamber. The ignition can directly ignite the fuel stream and diffus ive 
combustion of the gaseous fuel can be executed sequentially injecting the gaseous fuel toward a flame created by the ignition. Further, 
premix combustion of the gaseous fuel can also be performed by igniting an air-fuel mixture after the gaseous fuel injected from the 
in-cylinder injection valve has been sufficiently mixed with the air. As an operation mode of the engine, a lean premix combustion 
operation is selected when the engine is operated in a prescribed operation region, and the operation mode is changed to a diffusive 
combustion operation when the engine is operated in a higher load operation region than the prescribed operation region.

(57) Abstract : 
A blood filter device having a housing and a filter (8). The housing has a head section (2) having formed in it an inlet port (5) and 
forming an upper structure of the housing; a filtration section (3) for forming a central structure under the head section; and a bottom 
section (4) provided under the filtration section and having formed in it an outlet port (7). The filter (8) is installed in a cavity of the 
filtration section and partitioning a cavity of the housing into the head section side and the bottom section side. The filter is formed 
from a sheet-like filtration material folded into pleat, and the filter is placed such that ridges of the pleats traverse the cavity of the 
filtration section in parallel to each other. The bottom section has a circular cone section (4a) whose inner bottom surface forms  a 
circular cone surface projecting downward. Since the bottom section has the circular cone section, resistance to blood that passes the 
inside of the housing is reduced. As a result, pressure loss is suppressed to a sufficiently low level with the size of the blood filter 
device reduced and suffici ent filtration ability of the filter secured.

(57) Abstract : 
A tool holder assembly that includes a tool holder member adapted to be secured to a machine tool and a cutting insert support/clamp 
for clamping and supporting a cutting insert. The support/clamp member includes a plurality of serrations that are engageable with 
complementally formed serrations on the tool holder whereby a tight fitting engagement is achieved using removable fasteners.  The 
support/clamp includes a clamping arm elastically movable towards and away from a support base and a clamping block connected to 
the connecting arm adapted to receive clamping forces from a threaded clamping bolt. The clamping bolt defines a force applying 
surface located in a first plane whereas the clamping block defines a force receiving surface located in a second plane, the first and 
second planes located at a diverging angle with respect to each other. The clamping block includes an edge portion engageable with a 
step on the tool holder that is spaced from the clamping arm. The diverging planes and the engagement of the clamping block with the 
stepped portion increases the force applied by the clamping arm to the cutting insert for a given adjustment of the clamping bolt and 
resists rollover of the insert.

(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a method of detecting damage in a bearing supporting at least one rotary shaft of an engine in rotation, the 
method consisting in: defining (SI) a measurement period corresponding to a range of speeds of rotation of the shaft during renewable 
activity at low speeds of operation of the engine; acquiring (S2) over the entire measurement period a vibratory signal representative 
of acceleration of components of the engine; sampling (S3) the vibratory signal as a function of the speed of rotation of the shaft 
during the measurement period; transforming (S4) the sampled vibratory signal into a frequency signal to obtain frequency spectrum 
lines as a function of the speed of rotation of the shaft; cal culating (S5) the mean of the amplitudes of the spectrum lines; determining 
(S6) amplitude peaks around multiples of the theoretical frequency of a damaged roller; cal culating (S7) the ratio between each 
amplitude peak and the amplitude level determined for a sound bearing; and comparing (S8) the ratio that is obtained with at least one 
predetermined damage threshold.

(57) Abstract : 
The invention is a device for puri fying drinking water that has at least one fibrous structure. Preferably, there is an upstream and 
downstream fibrous structure. Each fibrous structure is a mixture of nano alumina fibers and second fibers arranged in a matrix to 
create asymmetric pores and to which fine, ultrafine, or nanosize particl es are attached. Preferably, the device has an upstream 
antimicrobial for sterilization of retained microbes. The device is substantially more efficient at removing soluble contaminants such 
as halogens from a fluid stream than those previously available and is also able to retain turbidity, bacteria, and virus.

(57) Abstract : 
An enhanced compiler for compiling C++ programs without the use of forward decl arations normally included in program header 
files. Through multiple parsing passes, the compiler extracts definitions for the declarations directly from the bodies of the C+ + files. 
By saving the definitions to a persistent program representation, for example a program database, on subsequent sweeps, only 
definitions for new or changed declarations need be updated. In this way, C++ programs can be incrementally compiled on a 
declaration by declaration basis.

(57) Abstract : 
An ABPI measurement system (1) includes two cuffs (10) for each ankle and two cuffs (10) for each arm of a patient. Each cuff (10) 
has chambers (11, 12). The four cuffs are applied to each limb (or finger or toe), each chamber (11) is inflated simultaneously to a 
pressure until a Pneumo Arterial Plethysmography (PAPG) signal related to the arterial flow in the limb is detected at the chambers 
(11). The chambers (12) are then simultaneously inflated until the PAPG signals are extinguished in each limb, the inflation of 
chambers (12) continuing for 10mmHg to 20mmHg above that pressure. The chambers (12) are then deflated and the pressure at 
which the PAPG signal returns in the first chamber (11) is recorded for each limb and this value of the pressure is used to calculate the 
ABPI. The ABPI is displayed or sent to a remote site.

(57) Abstract : 
A bed assembly (10) includes a frame (22) which supports four curved mattress support panels (50-56) which are abl e to move with 
pivoting of the various parts of the frame (22). The curved panels (50-56) better conform to a patient's body shape and provide an 
effective lengthening of the mattress support (50-56), particularly when the back rest (30, 50) is raised to a sitting position. The 
support panels (50-56) are locat ed below the pivot points of the frame (22), which further enhances the lengthening effect. The 
assembly also includes first and second patient retention panels (80, 82) with complementary edges (92, 94) which can slide over one 
another. A key pad unit (100) protrudes from the retention panel (80) at a convenient patient position and can be gripped by a p atient's 
hand.

(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for efficiently sending reports in a wireless communication system are described. Reports may be sent repetitively in 
accordance with a reporting format. A terminal receives an assignment of a control channel used to send reports and determines a 
reporting format to use based on the assignment. The reporting format indicates a speci fic sequence of reports sent in specific 
locations of a control channel frame. The terminal generates a set of reports for each reporting interval and arranges the set of reports 
in accordance with the reporting format. The terminal repetitively sends a plurality of sets of reports in a plurality of reporting 
intervals. Reports may also be sent adaptively based on operating conditions. An appropriate reporting format may be selected based 
on the operating conditions of the terminal, which may be characterized by environment (e.g., mobility), capabilities, QoS, and/or 
other factors.

(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus for communicating transmission backlog information are described. Reporting control factors are utilized to 
expand reporting possibilities for a fixed bit size request report. At least one report control factor is determined as a function of 
channel quality information, power information, device capability information, and/or quality of service information. A transmission 
backlog report value is interpreted as a function of a reporting control factor. A wide range of quantization schemes for reporting 
transmission backlog information are facilitated corresponding to a small bit size report. A communications device can adaptively 
select a quantization request level closely matched to its current needs such as to provide an accurate representation of its current 
traffic channel resource needs. A communications device may request a number of frames in a request report and the same report may 
be indirectly requesting a number of communications segments needed to clear its transmission backlog.

(57) Abstract : 
Wireless terminals and base stations support multiple modes of dedicat ed control channel operation wherein wireless terminals are 
allocated di fferent amounts of dedicated uplink resources for reporting control information. A set of dedicated control channel 
segments is utilized by a wireless terminal to communicate uplink control information reports to its serving base station attachment 
point. Full tone and split-tone modes of dedicated control channel operation are supported. In full tone mode, a single wireless 
terminal is allocated each of the dedicated control channel segments associated with a single logical tone. In split tone mode, dedicated 
control channel segments associated with a single logical tone are allocated between di fferent wireless terminals, with each of the 
multiple wireless terminals receiving a different non-overl apping subset of the dedicated control channel segments. Logical dedicated 
control channel tones can be dynamically reallocated for full-tone mode use or split.tone mode use.

(57) Abstract : 
Reporting methods well suited for reporting control information in a wireless system are described. A wireless terminal reports 
information to a serving base station, e.g., a base station attachment point, according to a reporting schedule. The reporting schedule 
includes a plurality of different types of fixed type information reports which communicate information of a type dictated by the 
reporting schedule. The reporting schedule also includes flexible reports at predet ermined locations within the reporting schedule. The 
wireless terminal selects the type of report to be communicated in the flexible report, e.g., as a function of a report prioritization 
operation. Information identifying the wireless terminal's report type selection for the flexible report is jointly coded along with the 
report body information and communicated in the same dedicated control channel segment. The reporting schedule repeats over time. 
In some embodiments there are more fixed reports than fl exible reports in one iteration of the schedule.

(57) Abstract : 
A method for enhancing the allocation of fluid flow rat es among a plurality of well bores in fluid communication with at least one 
subterranean reservoir is disclosed (24). An objective function and system equations are generated which utilize constraint violation 
penalties associated with soft constraints. The soft constraints are constraints which may be violated if necessary to arrive at a feasible 
solution to optimizing the objective function and the system equations. The fluid flow rates are then allocated among the well bores 
(30) as determined by the optimizing of the objective function and system equations. Fluid flow rates among well bores (30), 
particularly those exhibiting similar fluid characteristics, may be related to one another. Initial flow rates of components (oil, gas, and 
water) and pressures in the well bores (30) may be determined by an initial simulation run.

(57) Abstract : 
A gas meter comprises a conduit (1) for passage of a gas flow A and an ioniser (2) arranged to ionise the gas flow in the conduit (1). A 
modulating electrode structure (4) downstream of the ioniser modulates the ion distribution in the ionised gas flow. A first detecting 
electrode structure (8) and a second el ectrode structure (9) downstream of the modulating electrode structure 4 detect the modulated 
ion distribution in the ionised gas flow. The modulating electrode structure (4) and the detecting electrode structures (8, 9) can be 
configured to generate an elect rical field having at least a substantial component parallel to the direction of the gas flow. The 
modulating electrode structure (4) and the detecting electrode structures (8, 9) can comprise a pair of electrodes (5, 6, 10, 11), each 
having a plurality of apertures defined therein for passage of the gas flow. The modulating electrode structure (4) can be arranged to 
capture ions of one polarity, to generate an ionised gas flow comprising a majority of ions of the opposite polarity, in which case the 
detecting electrode structure can comprise at least one electrode (11) connect ed to a source of charge. Movement of the ionised gas 
flow relative to the electrode causes a redistribution of charge in the electrode, which generates a current indicative of the ion 
distribution between the electrode (11) and the charge source. The various arrangements provide a gas meter that can operate with a 
modulating voltage of less than (10) volts and is therefore suitable as a domestic gas meter.

(57) Abstract : 
An initial reporting structure for an uplink dedicated control channel is used by a wireless terminal following a transition into a state of 
wireless terminal operation or action which makes it desirable to provide a base station with an initial set of control information which 
can be used to support uplink transmission of user data. Subsequently while continuing operation in a state supporting uplink 
transmission of user data, a recurring scheduled reporting structure for the uplink dedicated control channel is followed by the wireless 
terminal. The initial reporting structure provides for communication of at least some information reports, e.g., infrequently scheduled 
reports, which may not have been otherwise communicated during the same time interval if the recurring scheduled reporting structure 
had not been overridden. Thus the use of initial report sets facilitates a rapid overall understanding by the serving base station 
attachment point of the wireless terminal's status.

(57) Abstract : 
A wireless terminal determines the transmission power used for its dedicated control channel at a point in time, and generates a power 
report indicating a ratio of a maximum wireless terminal transmit power to the transmit power of the dedicated control channel at the 
point in time. The power report provides a measure of availabl e transmit power for wireless terminal use for other purposes, e.g., 
uplink traffic channels, after taking into consideration the transmit power used for the dedicated control channel. The point in time has 
a known time offset from the start of a communications segment in which the power report is transmitted. This allows the base station 
receiving dedicated control channel uplink signals from the wireless terminal to measure the received signals, receive and process the 
communicated power report, and correlat e information to be used for accurate wireless terminal closed loop power control.

(57) Abstract : 
In a method for rehabilitation of a ballast bed (2) of a track (3) - in dependence upon the degree of fouling of the ballast bed (2) - in a 
first working method (A), an upper layer (34) of the ballast is picked up by a front clearing device (16) - with regard to a working 
direction - and transported to' a first conveyor belt unit (27). Parallel thereto, the remaining ballast (25) is picked up by a rear cl earing 
device (20) - with regard to the working direction - and transported to a second conveyor belt unit (29) to be carried away for disposal. 
In a second working method (B) which can be carried out selectively, the ballast (25) is picked up exclusively by the rear clearing 
device (20) and defl ected onto the first conveyor belt unit (27) for cleaning, while the front clearing device (16) is in an inoperative 
position. A deflecting device (33) is provided for selectively diverting the ballast from the second to the first conveyor belt unit (29, 
27).

(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to a double seat valve with cleanable seats, which is improved with regard to the prior art in that a discharge 
possibly free of turbulence of the seat cleaning flow into and out of the leakage cavity is ensured and a direct admission of the seat 
areas, which would increase pressure, is safely avoided. This is achieved in that the second closing element (4) abuts in its closed 
position at the transition area (2e; 2e*) with a stop face (4e) arranged at a front face of its cylindrical lug (4*) and that directly adjacent 
to the first seat (2a, 2g), that a central recess (4d) is provided in the front face of the second cylindrical lug (4*), which starts radially 
on the outside with a rotationally symmetrical diversion area (4b) (starting point of the contour (K)) and is bounded at the front by a 
front face (4e) oriented substantially vertically towards the longitudinal axis of the second closing element (4), the diversion area (4b) 
leading out into the front face (4c) (leading out point of the contour (K)), that the diversion area (4b) and the stop face (4e) form a 
second circumferential edge (U2), which is directly adjacent to a first end section (2g) of the first seat (2a) in the closed position of the 
second closing element (4), that, viewed in vertical centre section, the diversion area (4b) comprises a contour (K) with unbent shape, 
wherein a direction vector in the leading out point of the diversion area (4b) points into a discharge bore (3d) centrally arranged in the 
first closing element (3), without colliding with the first closing element (3) in the area of its areas bounding the leakage cavity (5) or 
of the intermediat e seal (8; 8*) and without forming impact pressure thereby, and that a frontal boundary of the fi rst closing element 
(3) directed towards the leakage cavity (5) has an axial safety distance (x) from the direction vector at an outlet point of the transition 
area (2e) formed as a first circumferential edge (Ul) into the first end section (2g).

(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus for routing messages between an end node and an access node via another access node are described. Physical 
layer identi fication information is used when identifying a remote, e.g., adjacent, access node as a message destination. Thus, when a 
connection identifi er based on one or more physical layer identi fiers is available to a wireless terminal, e.g., from one or more 
downlink signals received from a destination access node, the wireless terminal can use the connection identifier corresponding to the 
destination node to route a message via an access node with which it has an established uplink connection. Such connection identifier 
information can be used even when other addressing information, e.g., network layer address information, associated with the 
destination access node, may not be available to the wireless terminal.

(57) Abstract : 
When the binding of a mobile station (MS) in a home agent (HA) expires, the HA generates an identifi er from the MS's IMSI. The HA 
maintains a binding between the home address (HoA) and a speci al care of address (MAP-CoA), where the host ID of MAP-CoA is 
the identifier, and where the network ID of MAP-CoA is a special code. When a packet destined for the HoA is received at the HA, 
the HA responds by communicating the MAP-CoA to the PDSN that serves the special code. The PDSN recovers the IMSI from the 
host ID of the MAP-CoA, and uses the IMSI to page the MS. The MS responds by setting up a call, obtaining a new care of address, 
and then binding the new care of address with its HoA in the HA. Advantageously, packets can be sent to a dormant MS at its HoA 
without out-of-band signaling.

(57) Abstract : 
A method and apparatus to perform persistence tests for a mobile station (110) in a network (140) are described. A counter for t he 
random number generator configured to count access slots is initialized (401). One or more random numbers are successively 
generated (402, 403), until a value of a generat ed random number is lower than a first predetermined value (403). At the same time, 
the counter is successively incremented based on the number of generated random numbers. When the counter value is higher than or 
equal to a second predetermined value of successive iterations, the mobile station is deactivated (406) for a predetermined number of 
access slots equal to the counter value. Finally, if an access probe needs to be transmitted to the network, a random access number is 
generated (410) in preparation for transmission of the access probe to enable access to the network.

(57) Abstract : 
A video stream (for example, H.264 video) includes intra-encoded portions. Decoding an intra-encoded portion utilizes the result of 
decoding one or more other portions (called predecessors) in the frame. Frame reconstruction involves identifying a portion that has 
no predecessor portions that have not been decoded and then initiating decoding of the identified portion(s). When the decoding of a 
portion is substantially complete, then the remaining portions to be decoded are examined to identify portions that have no 
predecessors that have not been decoded. By carrying out this method, multiple portions may be decoded simultaneously. Each can be 
decoded on a different work entity, thereby increasing the rate of decoding of the overall frame. Because deblock filtering a 
predecessor destroys information needed in the intra-decoding of other portions, prefiltered predecessor information is stored in a 
buffer for subsequent use during intra-decoding, thereby facilitating simultaneous decoding of multiple portions.

(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate mitigation of interference in a wireless communication environment. 
Terminals can utilize interference information provided by neighboring sectors to adjust transmit power and reduce interference. 
Access points can provide two sets or types of interference information. The first type can be transmitted over a large coverage area, 
requiring significant overhead and limiting the transmission rate. Access points can also provide a second set or type of interference 
information directed at smaller coverage area, such as an area proximate to the edge of the supported sector. This second type of 
interference information can be utilized by terminals that include the access point within their active set. The second set of 
interference information can be provided at a higher rate than the first set due to decreased overhead requirements. Terminals can 
utilize both sets of interference information to adjust transmit power.

(57) Abstract : 
An apparatus and method are provided for restoring a remote user interface (RUI) in a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) environment. 
In the method, a client receiving an RUI from a server, requests that the state information of the RUI be saved. The method includes 
obtaining state information generat ed when the RUI is used, and requesting that the obtained state information be saved. Accordingly, 
it is possible to apply a method of storing and restoring state information of a remote user interface, in a UPnP environment, to an 
HTTP-based remote protocol model having stateless characteristics which do not allow state information of a remote user interface to 
be stored.

A wireless communications device is configurable to communicate with either one of two networks over a wireless medium, each of 
the two networks having a different air interface protocol. Additionally, the wireless device includes stored provisioning information 
for a set of networks of a first type and can map this first provisioning information into a second format for use with networks of a 
second type. The device also includes a non-volatile memory for storing default provisioning information so that some informat ion 
remains available regardless of what is erased from the memory. The default provisioning information is enough to establish a 
connection over one of the available networks and allow reconstruction of a provisioning list.

(57) Abstract : 
A pseudo-dual port memory (1) performs both a first memory access operation and a second memory access operation in a single 
period of an externally supplied clock signal CLK. The signal CLK is used to latch a first address for the first operation and a second 
address for the second operation. Control circuitry (3-15) generates first control signals that initiate the first operation. The time 
duration of the first operation depends upon a delay through a delay circuit (15). A precharge period follows termination of the first 
operation. The time duration of the precharge period depends upon a propagation delay through the control circuit. The memory 
access of the second operation is initiated following termination of the precharging. The time duration of the second memory access 
depends on a delay through the delay circuit. The time when the second operation is initiated is independent of the duty cycle of CLK.

(57) Abstract : 
Examples disclosed herein relate to methods and systems for enhancing performance of robust header compression (RoHC) 
compressor when encountering silence suppression. In one example, an RTP timestamp increment is calculated for successive packets, 
until a predetermined number of packets have a constant timestamp increment value. The constant RTP timestamp increment value is 
assigned as a timestamp stride (TS_STRIDE) value for compression, the value of each RTP timestamp (TS) is scaled by timestamp 
stride (TS_STRIDE) and the header is compressed using the assigned value.

(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate serving sector directed transmit power control in a wireless communication 
environment. Under certain conditions, an access point can have better data with which to determine appropriate power levels than an 
individual terminal. Accordingly, an access point can transmit power control information to one or more terminals supported by the 
access point overriding normal power determination procedures. In particular, power control information can be included within an 
assignment message that designates resources (e.g., frequency, time) assigned to a terminal. Power control information can be based 
upon SNR, quality of service requirements, interference information, any other relevant information or any combination thereof.

(57) Abstract : 
This disclosure describes adaptive filtering techniques to improve the quality of captured imagery, such as video or still images. In 
particular, this disclosure describes adaptive filtering techniques that filter each pixel as a function of a set of surrounding pixel s. An 
adaptive image filter may compare image information associat ed with a pixel of interest to image information associat ed with a set of 
surrounding pixels by, for example, computing differences between the image information associated with the pixel of interest and 
each of the surrounding pixels of the set. The computed differences can be used in a variety of ways to filter image information of the 
pixel of interest. In some embodiments, for example, the adaptive image filter may include both a low pass component and high pass 
component that adjust as a function of the computed differences.

The invention relates to a bobbin (1) which comprises a bobbin housing (8) and a strip or thread-shaped materi al (5) which is wound 
thereon in a plurality of layers, at least one marking (MA; ME), which is in the form of a significant modi fication of the laying angle 
(f), is provided in order to display properties of the winding material (5). The invention also relates to a device which is used to 
identify the properties of winding material (5) on said type of bobbin (1). Said bobbin is associated with a rotational speed sensor (3). 
An output signal (6) of the rotational speed sensor is guided to a calculating unit (10) and the fluctuations of the output signal of the 
rotational speed sensor (3) according to the detection charact eristics of the cal culating unit, which occur when the winding material (5) 
is wound, produce an output signal (11) during unwinding in the region of the marking, whereas traditional rotational speed signals 
from non-marked areas of the winding material of the bobbin are processed by the calculating unit (10) in such a manner that no active 
output signal (11) is emitted.

(57) Abstract : 
The disclosure is directed to techniques for automatic segmentation of a region-of -interest (ROI) video object from a video sequence. 
ROI object segmentation enables selected ROI or 'foreground' objects of a video sequence that may be of interest to a viewer to be 
extract ed from non-ROI or 'background' areas of the video sequence. Examples of a ROI object are a human face or a head and 
shoulder area of a human body. The disclosed techniques include a hybrid technique that combines ROI feature detection, region 
segmentation, and background subtraction. The ROI detection uses a combined foreground region of the frame corresponding to the 
moving foreground region and a foreground region of a previous video frame in the video sequence . In this way, the disclosed 
techniques may provide accurate foreground object generation and low- complexity extraction of the foreground object from the video 
sequence. A ROI object segmentation system may implement the techniques described herein. In addition, ROI object segmentation 
may be useful in a wide range of multimedia applications that utilize video sequences, such as video telephony applications and video 
surveillance applications.

A method of providing an input signal to a mixer circuit comprises coupling an output signal from a low-noise amplifier circuit to a 
mixer input of the mixer circuit via an AC coupling circuit, comprising an inductive of capacitive coupling circuit. For capacitive 
coupling configurations, a coupling capacitor is configured to have a capacitance value determined as a function of a transconductance 
sensitivity of the mixer circuit. For balanced output configurations of the low-noise amplifier circuit, matched coupling capacitors are 
used for coupling the balanced output signals to respective inputs of the mixer circuit. In one embodiment, the mixer circuit comprises 
a quadrature mixer circuit, which may be in a balanced or double-balanced configuration. In another embodiment, the mixer circuit 
comprises a four-phase mixer circuit, which may be configured as a balanced four-phase mixer circuit coupled to the low-noise 
amplifier circuit via inductive or capactive embodiments of the coupling circuit.

(57) Abstract : 
This disclosure describes a number of techniques for processing multimedia data that can improve multi-program 'picture-in-picture' 
viewing, particularly in a wireless mobile apparatus setting. In one example, a method includes receiving multiple channels of t he 
multimedia data, decoding frames associat ed with two or more of the channels, presenting first frames of a first channel at a firs t 
frame rate, and presenting second frames of a second channel at a second frame rate while presenting the first frames, wherein the 
second frame rate is lower than the first frame rate. In another example, method includes receiving multiple channels of the 
multimedia data, receiving channel switch frames (CSFs) associated with the multiple channels, and simultaneously presenting the 
CSFs associated with two or more of the multiple channels to a user.

(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for supporting communication with disjoint links and common links are described. A sector may broadcast an overhead 
message and/or send unicast messages to indicate whether the sector supports disjoint links. A terminal may receive at least one 
message indicating whether disjoint links are supported by at least one sector. When disjoint links are supported, a forward link (FL) 
serving sector and a reverse link (RL) serving sector may be independently selected for the terminal. When disjoint links are not 
supported, a single sector may be selected as both the FL and RL serving sectors for the terminal. Handoff of the terminal may be 
performed independently for the forward and reverse links if disjoint links are supported and may be performed jointly if disjoint links 
are not supported.

(57) Abstract : 
A method and apparatus for adaptive green channel odd-even mismatch removal to effectuate the disappearance of arti facts caused by 
the odd-even mismatch in a demosaic processed image. In one adaptive approach, a calibrated GR channel gain for red rows and a 
calibrated GB channel gain for blue rows are determined and are a function of valid pixels only in each respective region. After the 
calibration, in a correction process, the green pixels in red rows of a region are multiplied by the calibrated GR channel gain. On the 
other hand, the green pixels in blue rows are multiplied by the calibrated GB channel gain. Thus, after demosaic processing, the 
corrected image has essentially no artifacts caused by odd-even mismatch of the green channel. Alternately, the adaptive green 
channel odd-even mismatch removal method replaces the cent er green pixel of a region having an odd number of columns and rows 
with a normalized weighted green pixel sum total. The weighted green pixel sum total adds the center green pixel weighted by a first 
weighting factor, a sum of a first tier layer of weighted green pixel values based on a second weighting factor and a sum of a second 
tier layer of weighted green pixel values based on a third weighting factor.

(57) Abstract : 
Techniques for performing power control and handoff are described. In an aspect, power control (PC) is supported with multiple PC 
modes such as an up-down PC mode and an erasure-based PC mode. One PC mode may be selected for use. Signaling may be sent to 
indicate the selected PC mode. If the up-down PC mode is selected, then a base station estimates the received signal quality for a 
terminal and sends PC commands to direct the terminal to adjust its transmit power. If the erasure-based PC mode is selected, then the 
base station sends erasure indications that indicate whether codewords received from the terminal are erased or non-erased. For both 
PC modes, the terminal adjusts its transmit power based on the power control feedback (e.g., PC commands and/or erasure 
indications) to achieve a target level of performance (e.g., a target erasure rate for the codewords). The erasure indications may also be 
used for handoff.

(57) Abstract : 
A wireless communications system supports wireless connections between base station sector attachment points and wireless 
terminals. Individual wireless connections correspond to one of a downlink-macrodiversity mode of operation and a downlink non-
macrodiversity mode of operation. A wireless terminal has,, for each of its current connections, a base station assigned dedicated 
control channel for communicating uplink control information reports. The uplink control information reports include downlink 
signal-to-noise ratio reports based on measured received pilot channel signals. If a connection corresponds to a macrodiversity mode 
of operation, a reporting format for the SNR report is used which reports (i) an SNR value and (ii) an indication as to whether or not 
the connection is considered a preferred connection by the wireless terminal. If a connection corresponds to a non-macrodiversity 
mode of operation, a reporting format for the SNR report is used which reports an SNR value.

(57) Abstract : 
A processor having a multistage pipeline includes a TLB and a TLB controller. In response to a TLB miss signal, the TLB controller 
initiates a TLB reload, requesting address translation information from either a memory or a higher-level TLB, and placing that 
information into the TLB. The processor flushes the instruction having the missing virtual address, and refetches the instruction, 
resulting in re-insertion of the instruction at an initial stage of the pipeline above the TLB access point. The initiation of the TLB 
reload, and the flush/refetch of the instruction, are performed substantially in parallel, and without immediately stalling the pipeline. 
The refetched instruction is held at a point in the pipeline above the TLB access point until the TLB reload is complete, so that the 
refetched instruction generates a 'hit' in the TLB upon its next access.

(57) Abstract : 
In general, this disclosure describes techniques for exchanging information between a plurality of encoder modules and a multiplex 
module to combine segments of data from the encoder modules with an improved overall quality. In particular, the encoder modules 
associate their respective segments of dat a with quality and rate information and send at least the quality and rate information 
associated with the segments of data to the multiplex module. The multiplex module analyzes the quality and rate information to 
determine whether the segments of data that encoder modules desire to include in the current superframe fit within the available 
bandwidth of a transmission channel. If the multiplex module determines the plurality of segments of data do not fit within the 
available bandwidth, the multiplex module selects one or more of the segments to be resized based on the quality and rate information 
received from the encoder modules.

(57) Abstract : 
The present invention relates to an electrical power transmission system (100) which utilizes HVDC technology to supply power over 
long distance to an underwater system (130) such as a modular seabed processing system (300). The system (100) comprises a host 
station (110), a remote power conversion facility (120) and an Integrated Service Umbilical (150) which is connected to the 
underwater system (130). The host station (110) transmits DC power through a submarine power cable (140) to the remote power 
conversion facility (120) which is more than 100 km from the host station (110). Thereon, the remote power conversion facility (120) 
which includes a DC to AC inverter (123), a transformer (122) and a local control station (121), converts the DC power to the required 
AC power for the underwater system (130). The operation of the transmission of power to the underwater system (130) is monitored 
and controlled through a master local control station (111) at the host station (110) and/or a local control station (121) on the remote 
power conversion facility (120). Advantageously, electrical power may be supplied to an underwater system (130) which is more than 
100 km from a power source. In addition, the underwater system (130) and the power transmitted can be remotely monitored and 
controlled.

(57) Abstract : 
For a call flow to perform position determination, a network (100) sends to a user equipment (UE) (120) an indication (e.g., a request 
for permission) to perform a position fix for the UE (120). The UE (120) responds by sending to the network an acknowledgment 
(e.g., a grant of permission) to perform the position fix. The UE (120) selectively sends a position estimate for itself to the network 
(100), typically along with the acknowledgment. The network (100) may initiate location processing if (1) a position estimate is not 
received from the UE (120) or (2) a position estimate is received from the UE (120) but the network (100) decides not to use this 
position estimate. In this case, the network (100) and the UE (120) perform location processing to obtain a position fix for the UE 
(120). However, if a position estimate is received from the UE (120) and the network (100) decides to use the position estimate, then 
the location processing is bypassed or short circuited.

(57) Abstract : 
A horizontally polarized antenna array allows for the effi cient distribution of RF energy into a communications environment through 
selectable ant enna elements and redirectors that create a particul ar radiation pattern such as a substantially omnidirectional radiation 
pattern. In conjunction with a vertically polarized array, a particular high-gain wirel ess environment may be created such that one 
environment does not interfere with other nearby wirel ess environments and avoids interference created by those other environments. 
Lower gain patterns may also be creat ed by using particular configurations of a horizontal and/or vertical antenna array. In a preferred 
embodiment, the antenna systems disclosed herein are utilized in a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) wireless environment.

(57) Abstract : 
In a wireless communication system, an apparatus and a method are provided for controlling reverse link interference among access 
terminals that are power controlled by a sector of a base station. In an embodiment, the maximum effective noise power spectral 
density is used as a parameter for controlling the level of reverse link loading, by setting a reverse activity bit (RAB) to signal the 
access terminals to reduce their data rates in order to minimize interference between the access terminals i f the maximum effect ive 
noise power spectral density is above a predetermined threshold.

(57) Abstract : 
For delayed transmission after reconfiguration of the physical layer, a wireless network initially sends a first message (e.g., a 
Reconfiguration message) to a wireless device for reconfiguration of uplink and/or downlink physical channels. The wireless network 
then performs synchronization to establish the uplink physical channels, and the wireless device performs synchronization to establish 
the downlink physical channels. Upon completing the downlink synchronization, the wireless device sends a second message (e.g., a 
Reconfiguration Complete message) to the wireless network. The wireless network sends a Layer 2 acknowledgment (L2 ACK) upon 
success fully decoding the second message. The wireless network delays transmission of signaling/data on the downlink, except for 
transmission of certain messages such as those needed for reconfiguration, until success ful decoding of the second message. The 
wireless device del ays transmission of signaling/data on the uplink, again except for cert ain messages, until reception of the L2 ACK.

(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus related to determining, communicating, and/or using delay information are described. A wireless terminal 
determines delay information corresponding to queued information that it intends to transmit. The delay information includes a 
maximum queuing delay indicting a maximum amount of time data to be transmitted has been waiting to be transmitted. The 
determined delay information is communicated to a base station in a control information report. Alternatives formats for the control 
information report are possible including a report type conveying only delay information and a report type conveying delay 
information and queue backlog count information jointly coded. A base station uses received delay information received from one or 
more wireless terminals to effi ciently schedule uplink traffi c channel segments.

(57) Abstract : 
In a meeting or group event, people having a portable device, such as a cell phone or pager, may wish to be discretely notified when 
an important message is received, an urgent call comes in from a selected person or a select ed group of people, or to be alerted to an 
upcoming important event without any audible alert to disturb the meeting or group event. To convey such a notification, a tactile alert 
is provided by vibrating the portable device according to a unique vibration pattern associated with the received communication. 
When a communication is received, a group identification (ID) is assigned based on the communication being a member of a 
classi fied group of source addresses. The portable device associates the group ID with a unique vibration pattern. To provide the alert, 
the portable device is vibrated according to the unique vibration pattern.

(57) Abstract : 
A pre-saturating multiplier inspects the operands to a multiply operation prior to performing any multiplication. If the operands will 
cause an overflow requiring saturation, the multiplier outputs the saturated value without multiplying the original operands. In one 
embodiment, parameters derived from the operands are altered such that when the multiply operation is performed on the altered 
parameters, the multiplier produces the saturated result. This may comprise altering a Booth recoded bit group to select a negative zero 
instead of a zero as a partial product, and suppressing the addition of the value one to the partial products (thus effectively subtracting 
the value one). In another embodiment, when the operands that will cause an overflow are det ected, the output of the multiplier is 
forced to a predetermined saturation value.

(57) Abstract : 
In a processor, there are situations where instructions and some parts of a program may reside in a data cache prior to execution of the 
program. Hardware and software techniques are provided for fetching an instruction in the data cache aft er having a miss in an 
instruction cache to improve the processor's performance. If an instruction is not present in the instruction cache, an instruction fetch 
address is sent as a data fetch address to the data cache. If there is valid data present in the data cache at the supplied instruction fetch 
address, the data actually is an instruction and the data cache entry is fet ched and supplied as an instruction to the processor complex. 
An additional bit may be included in an instruction page table to indicate on a miss in the instruction cache that the data cache should 
be checked for the instruction.

(57) Abstract : 
Methods and apparatus related to determining, communicating, and/or using delay information are described. A wireless terminal 
determines delay information corresponding to queued information that it intends to transmit. The delay information includes a 
minimum time to a transmission deadline indicating a minimum amount of time remaining before information will be discarded if not 
transmitted. The determined delay information is communicated to a base station in a control information report. Alternatives formats 
for the control information report are possible including a report type conveying only delay information and a report type conveying 
delay information and queue backlog count information jointly coded. A base station uses received delay information received from 
one or more wireless terminals to effici ently schedule uplink traffi c channel segments.

(57) Abstract : 
A wireless device stores historical information for a prior access attempt and uses this information to lower the output transmit power 
for a current access attempt on an access channel. The historical information may include RF conditions for the prior access attempt, 
the performance for the prior access attempt, and a power value used for the prior access attempt. The power value may be a power 
adjustment or an initial power level. For the current access attempt, the wireless device obtains the historical information, determines 
the current RF conditions, and determines a power value for this access attempt based on the current RF conditions and the historical 
information. The wireless device determines the output power for each access probe based on the power value and other applicable 
parameters and sends each access probe at the determined output power. The wireless device updates the historical information upon 
completing the access attempt.

A digital type wireless monitoring system includes transmitters having cameras therewith; and a receiver displaying image signals on 
a screen, the image signals being captured with the cameras at the transmitters and received wirelessly while being installed within a 
speci fied distance from the transmitters. Each transmitter performs an MPEG-4 encoding, which compresses only the image signals 
while excluding audio signals; and creates a file by combining a header containing information of each transmitter and communication 
standard with each of the image signals for each frame. Further, the receiver having a permanent IP address receives the files received 
by an AP; receives the files containing header information via the AP; -streaming replays images of many. channels simultaneously or 
images of a single channel by using a streaming viewer; stores the image signals of each transmitter being streaming replayed to a 
designated storage space under the control of a supervisor.

(57) Abstract : 
Power consumption of a mobile communication device is reduced by disabling refreshing of unused portions of DRAM. DRAM 
includes multiple separately refreshable memory refresh ranges (MRRs). A memory refresh manager (MRM) within the device's 
operating system identifies ranges of virtual memory (305) that will not be used during subsequent sleep mode operation. The MRM 
(307) remaps virtual to physical memory space to conglomerate the physical memory pages (associated with virtual memory that will 
not be used) in certain MRRs such that the contents of entire MRRs need not be maintained in sleep mode (308). Information in any 
remapped physical page that needs to be maintained during sleep mode is copied so that it resides at the same virtual address after the 
remapping as before. Other software operates in virtual memory space and is not affect ed by the remapping (309). Refreshing of the 
certain MRRs is then disabled for sleep mode (310), thereby reducing power consumption.

(57) Abstract : 
A broadband service is provided by allocating air interface resources in a wireless network that conforms to the 1xEV-DO standard. 
The air interface resources are characterized by various quality of service (QoS) parameters, such as bandwidth, packet priority and 
error rate. Packetized information is transmitted in data flows between a base station and cell phones. A particular QoS level is 
reserved for each of the data flows that support the broadband service. An operating system on a cell phone monitors one data flow as 
well as another data flow in the opposite direction. When the base station runs out of an air interface resource, the base station 
suspends the QoS reservation of a data flow. The operating system determines that the QoS reservation in one direction has been 
suspended and sends an unsolicited message to the base station releasing the QoS reservation in the opposite direction, thereby 
conserving network resources. forward data flow

(57) Abstract : 
Provided are an apparatus and method of restoring a remote user interface (RUI) in a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) environment. In 
the apparatus and method, an RUI client requests an external storage server to store the state information of the RUI by using a 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) object processing a HTTP request without reloading a web page, and restores the original state of 
the RUI by using the stored state information. Accordingly, it is possible to apply a method of storing and restoring state information 
of a remote user interface, in a UPnP environment, to a HTTP-based remote protocol model having stateless characteristics which do 
not allow state information of a remote user interface to be stored.

(57) Abstract : 
Systems and methodologies are described that facilitate constructing unitary matrices that may be utilized in linear precoding for 
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. Each unitary matrix may be generated by combining (e.g., 
multiplying) a diagonal matrix with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) matrix. The unitary matrices may be utilized to provide 
feedback rel ated to a channel and/or control transmission over a channel based upon obtained feedback.

(57) Abstract : 
The disclosure relates to techniques for video source rat e control for video telephony (VT) applications. The source video encoding 
rate may controlled using a dual-buffer based estimation of a frame budget that defines a number of encoding bits available for a 
frame of the video. The dual-buffer based estimation technique may track the fullness of a physical video buffer and the fullness of the 
virtual video buffer. The source video encoding rate is then controlled based on the resulting frame budget. The contents of the virtual 
buffer depend on constraints imposed by a target encoding rate, while the contents of the physical buffer depend on constraints 
imposed by varying channel conditions. Consideration of physical video buffer fullness permits the video source rate control 
technique to be channel-adaptive. Consideration of virtual video buffer fullness permits the video source rate control technique to 
avoid encoding excessive video that could overwhelm the channel.

(57)Abstract  :
A braid-reinforced composite hollow fiber membrane is disclosed. The braid-reinforced composite hollow fiber membrane comprising 
a reinforcing material of a tubular braid and a polymer resinous thin film coat ed on the surface of the tubular braid is characterized in  
that: the tubular braid comprises multifilaments made of monofilaments having a fineness of 0.01 to 0.4 denier, and the peeling 
strength of the tubular braid and a polymer resinous thin film coated on the surface thereof is 1 to 10 MPa. In the composite hollow 
fiber membrane, the fineness of the monofil aments constituting the tubular braid of the reinforcing materi al is small, that is, 0.01 to 
0.4 denier, thus the surface area of the tubular braid contacted with the polymer resinous thin film is increased. Thus, the peeling 
strength of the tubular braid and the polymer resinous thin film coated on the surface thereof is excellent, and at the same time, the 
initial wetting property of the composite hollow fiber membrane is excellent, that is, 80 to 120%, due to a capillary tube phenomenon 
or the like.

(57) Abstract : 
The pack, made of biodegradable, hygienically non-stabilized, i.e. potentially unhealthy substrate, is placed into a space separated 
from the surrounding atmosphere and put through aerobic fermentation involving the step of exposing the whole volume of the pack at 
the same time to the temperature of 70°-80° C for 30-60 min. With an advantage, the temperature of the pack is controlled during the 
fermentation by the amount of externally supplied air and by intensity of restacking of the pack. The product of the aerobic 
fermentation is hygienically stabilized, i.e. unobjectionable product, suitable for further processing without the necessity of any special 
hygienic means such as composting or processing into fuel.

The invention relates to a stent for insertion into and placement inside a body cavity of a human being or an animal, said stent being 
intended for having a first configuration during insertion into the cavity and said stent, aft er having been placed in the cavity, being 
intended for having a second configuration. In an aspect of the invention, an expandable part is constituted by at least one first section 
of at least one helical winding in a clockwise direction and at  least one second section of at least one helical  winding in a counter-
clockwise direction, each of said fi rst and second at l east one section being radially expandable so that during expansion, and where 
the at least one first section will be rotating in counter-clockwise direction and the at least one second section will be rotating in 
clockwise direction. In another aspect of the invention, a non-straight curvature of the ret aining part is capable of conforming to a 
curvature of the body cavity, thereby avoiding migration of the stent along the body cavity, and substantially without application of 
radial forces from the retaining part onto the body cavity walls.

(57)Abstract: 
The gas detector device comprises at least a VCSEL source and at least a light sensor for detecting a light beam having passed through 
a sample chamber containing a given gas to be detected. The detection signal of the sensor directly provided to or is time derivated by 
an elect ronic derivator and then provided to respective lock-in ampli fiers in order to generate a two di fferent 2f-detection, f being the 
frequency of a wavelength modulation of the source, and thus to provide two corresponding measuring signals the division of which 
gives a precise value of the gas concentration. The invention uses at least a first modulation reference signal at twice and a second 
modulation reference signal at twice of the modulation frequency of the laser source. Providing at least a first 2f modulation reference 
signal has advantages over the prior art, because by using such a reference modulation signal it is possible measure the absolute 
intensity and therefore to receive the same result at different temperatures or at mode hopping of the laser. A further advantage is that 
the measurement accuracy is independent from the gas concentration.

(57) Abstract : 
This invention APPLICATION OF HEAT DISSIPATED BY REFRIGERATOR CONDENSER IN DEVELOPMENT 
OFINTEGRATED HOT BOX IN REFRIGERATOR, is aimed at providing an integrated Hot Box & Cold Box, thereby saving on 
energy and the cost. An insulated hot box is provided over a conventional refrigerator and the heat required for the Hot Box is directly 
pumped from the condenser of the Refrigerator, which normally was dissipated to the surroundings and used to go as a waste, the 
energy being untapped. This invention makes uses of the energy, which was going as a waste by mounting the Evaporator in the 
Refrigerator and the Condenser in the Hot Box, thereby directly pumping the heat from the refrigerator to the Condenser, without 
draining it to the surroundings. Thus, a single machine does both the heating and cooling. Presently, two separate machines were used 
to achieve cooling and heating.

cylinders, the cams moveable by said key cylinders and having abutment projections adapted to be engaged and disengaged with 
complimentary recesses formed into shackle limb ends, wherein fi rst cam is engaged with shorter limb end in locked position and 
disengages the same in unlocked position, the said cam is always in locked position wherein the key is removed from the said first key 
cylinder, when the key is inserted into first key cylinder and rotated through 90° clockwise, the said cam disengages with the shackle 
thereby allowing the shackle to move to open position of the said lock, a second can fitted partially moveable by the second key 
cylinder wherein a key can be inserted and removed in both the locked and unlocked positions of the second cam, this locks the 
second longer limb of the shackle, the said cam is always in disengagement with shackle limb to permit the lock to operate normally 
with the first key cylinder, when the said second key is inserted into said second cylinder and turned through 360° clockwise thereby 
rotating the said second cam through 90° clockwise which engages with the complimentary recesses provided on second limb of the 
shackle thereby providing the locking of second limb and key removed from the locking cylinder, the closing and opening of the 
shackle by the first key cylinder is prevented, thus the second key cylinder overrides the access of first key cylinder and makes it

(57) Abstract : 
We have today load lengths in thousands of kilometers WE' cannot think of anv other types of long roads other than tar loads, in spite 
of road construction done in most correct presents considered technical manner, tat/asphalt toads require repairs very oft en as they 
develop pot holes and it can he called a global phenomena The efforts required in terms of time, money and labor arc rather 
tremendous. Since the roads get damaged irrespective of the agency (owners, builders, repairers), one cannot attribute am other 
reason, other than technical for the significant deterioration of road condition in a very small lime span. While studying the problem 
technically, a comparison of road and rail track designs was made and two points came to surface. (1) Unlike railways, there is no 
means of converting point loads to general loading in case of present road design. In rail design this occurs due to the rails themselves. 
(2) Unlike railways, again, there is no means of stopping material dislodging in case a small pot-hole gets created. In railway design 
the soil underneath the sleepers only gets pressed down due to load and traffic. Further, in older railway track designs they had 
employed hemispherical bowls to ensure that soil docs not get eroded. Keeping above points in mind and considering present road 
design to be inadequate, method or design of "Permanent Type Tar/Asphalt Road Construction and Repair In the use of steel grid 
below the road surface" is put forth as a novel idea that will significantly reduce road det erioration and save cost and inconvenience to 
the public.

(57) Abstract : 
A cutter tool includes first and second elongate members carrying a cutting blade pivotally attached with the second elongate member 
and slidably attached with the first elongate member to enable cutting an associated tubular wokpiece with an increased mechanical 
advantage with the tool in an opened position. The tool is characterized by a first handle having a cradle for supporting a tube to be 
cut, a second handle pivotally attached to the first handle, a cutter blade attached to the second handle for displacement therewith and 
relative thereto, and a pin and slot interengagement between the cutter blade and the first handle by which the angular displacement of 
the cutter blade from an opened to a closed position relative to the cradle is greater than the angular displacement of the handles to 
achieve such blade displacement. The slot configuration provides for displacement of the blade relative to the cradle to initially apply 
a higher cutting forcewhich is followed by a transition to a lower cutting force and a higher rate of blade displacement.

(57) Abstract : 
The present invention comprises a solar thermal energy collection system to heat water which is made up basically of an assembly of 
solar panels, build from plates or hollow-cell structured sheets of fixed width and variable lenght, and a system to store the energy 
comprising two twin containers, one for the actual heat storage (which can just contain pure water) and another to hold the liquid that 
flows inside the collectors. The solar collector in these panels is transparent being the solar heat absorbed directly by the liquid that 
runs in them, which is opaque to the radiation. The container that holds this liquid is at atmospheric pressure and the liquid that is 
pumped into the panels gets back into the container just by gravity. Whenever there is not enough solar radiation, or in case of 
malfunction, the pump stops and the absorber liquid drains back into the tank. The collectors will then be empty and translucent  
which, on one hand, avoids freezing caused by low external temperatures and, on the other hand, prevents that they overheat under 
excessive radiation. The low-pressure and low-temperature working characteristic of this system allows it to be built essentially from 
polymeric materials with their well know advantages, such as simpler production and assembly methods, better insulation, less weight, 
lower costs, etc. This invention also discloses another novel characteristic which refers to the fact that the same panel, built from three 
hollow-cell structured plates, can be used as an element that is, simultaneously, absorber, radiant and dissipater, that is, by circulating 
appropriat e liquids it can absorb heat in its central plate, can radiate (or absorb) heat on its back plate and can also dissipate heat from 
its frontal plate.

(57)Abstract: 
The present invention relates particularly relates to a novel type of hinge to be used for sequentially interconnecting different 
elemental jewellery units of item. Type of hinge constructions used in jewellery units of jewellery making of prior art do not  permit 
the jewellery item to ret ain during use its appropriate shape which is requi red for bringing out beauty value of the jewellery it em like 
the diamond-studded necklace. The necklace may present itself as an ordinary metal chain, which, as if, “ falls down loose”, giving U –
shape or any other unplanned shape. Hinge- construction of prior art does not restrict movement of di fferent el emental jewellery units 
in different unplanned directions. The difficulty becomes more pronounced when very small size diamonds are used in the necklace. 
The novel type of hinge of the present invention provides two mating pairs for each elemental jewellery units permit each unit to have 
predetermined appropri ate amount of clockwise and anticlockwise rotational motions. This helps the jewellery items take and retain its 
planned appropri ate shape to achi eve gracefulness and beauty, giving very attractive and impressive appearance. Hinge – const ruction 
of present invention can be used for making different jewellery items such as necklace, bracel ets, earrings and the like.

(57) Abstract : 
The present invention generally relates to jewellery making and particularly relates to intertwined – braidlike jewellery and novel 
method of making the same. When completed jewellery item is made by assembling many very small elemental jewellery units, the 
work of formation of interconnection of assembled small units poses many diffi culties for the artisans which add to the cost and time –
duration of assembly work. This assembled completed jewellery item also present a flat two dimensional appearance which reduces 
both attractiveness and hence value of jewellery item. The present invention provides a novel shape of small elemental jewellery units, 
such that the work of interconnection - work, used by earlier jewellery units gives additional advantage of presenting a three 
dimensional appearance, thereby increasing attractiveness and value of jewellery item. The present invention can be used for making 
jewellery items like necklace, bracelets, pendants, earring and the like.

(57) Abstract : 
Present invention provides new process for the deposition of extremely thin titanium dioxide compact films on tin doped indium oxide 
(ITO) substrate in the form of nanocrystalline rutile phase from an aqueous solution bath containing one and the same metallic 
precursor such as TiCl3. This invention also provides and information about change in surface appearance with pH of deposition bath 
such as violet at pH?2.5 and brown at 6.5, respectively. Depending upon appearance, change in optical absorption is noted. Present 
observations are supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscope studies. The titanium dioxide thin films are of l arge 
area, nanocrystalline and appeared in different colors from violet to brown which is effectively useful for absorption of visible light 
for the solar cells, depending upon the synthesis conditions. The room temperature synthesized thin films of rutile titanium dioxide 
make it a potential candidate for high-compatibility material that can be used in artificial heart valves. The titanium dioxide films so 
formed are nanocrystalline in nature with pure rutile phase and grain size 2-10 nm and compact and well adherent to the ITO 
substrates. The films are superhydrophic having water surface contact angle less than 20°.

(57) Abstract : 
A method for real-time content transfers between two devices ensuring that the network or the end devices do not get choked. Real-
time requirements are stringent for allowing audio-video/multimedia files to be played immediately. The method involves sending the 
files isochronously using uniformly spaced UDP packets. The overall rate of transfer, can be higher than that required for real-time 
playing, allowing faster downloads of the file. Since, the method ensures that the network or the devices do not get chocked, it is good 
for all kind of file transfers – even those where real time play is not applicable. The method ensures that a device can transfer multiple 
files simultaneously to different devices, limited only by network bandwidth and the processing power. This method empowers even 
lightweight devices such as STB with Hard-disk to functions as Servers for Peer-to-Peer file video transfers. Unlike UDP protocol, 
this methodology ensures reliable file transfers. Unlike, TCP protocol, this methodology ensures real-time file transfers, which are not 
affected by distance. Unlike both UDP and TCP protocols, this method doesn’t choke the network or devices. Unlike RTSP protocol, 
this method uses only UDP packets for data as well as control purposes. The Real-time Isochronous File Transfer methodology also 
ensures that ongoing file transfers are not affected by any new Isochronous file transfers. This prevents congestion in the network. 
This is achieved by testing out the efficacy of a new file transfer, at a lower QOS level, before it is continued at a higher QOS level. If 
insuffi cient bandwidth is present the new file transfer is not initiated. For real-time playing, the downloading is always ahead of the 
playing point. This facilitates the user to Fast Forward from the current playing point, till the downloading point. Other VCR functions 
are provided from the local storage itsel f. Unlike RTSP protocol, this method does not require the VCR controls to be sent to the 
server side, and the sever side sending different streams in response. Unlike RTSP, this methodology ensures that the entire video file 
is transferred continuously, irrespective of VCR controls (including Pause) being used by the user.

(57) Abstract : 
An applicator is disclosed which includes a thin walled member adapted to hold and dispense a substance. An apparatus is also 
disclosed for forming a curl on an end of the applicator. The applicator has a thin wall formed from at least two separate distinct layers 
and has first and second spaced apart ends. The applicator also has an outwardly extending fingergrip ring integrally formed adjacent 
to the second end which serves to facilitate control of the insertion of a substance into a body cavity or on an area of the skin and 
furthermore eases removal of the applicator from a body cavity. The apparatus includes first and second members. The first member is 
capable of holding the tubular member and has an external shoulder beyond which the first end of the tubular member extends a set 
amount. The second member is coaxially aligned with and is engageable with the first end of the tubular member. The second member 
is coaxially aligned with and is engageable with the first end of the tubular member. The second member includes a pilot which is 
sized to be inserted into the first end of the tubular member. The second member also includes a sleeve which surrounds the pilot and 
cooperates with the extemal shoulder when the second member engages the first end of the tubular member to form a curling chamber. 
The second member further includes a curling element positioned between the pilot and the sleeve which is capable of contacring the

(57) Abstract : 
A method for manufacturing a twisted yarn includes the step of removing two rovings from two separate supplies and passing each 
roving through a separate drawing device. From each roving a separate spun yarn is produced by ring-spinning. Each spun yarn is 
collected in the form of a bobbin on a yarn carrier of separate hollow spindles, wherein the separate hollow spindles are positioned 
atop one another. With formation of a yarn balloon the spun yarn is withdrawn from the bobbins and guided through the hollow 
spindle axle of the respective hollow spindle. The spun yarn withdrawn from the upper one of the hollow spindles is guided through 
the hollow spindle axle of the lower one of the hollow spindles. Both spun yarns are then guided together to a winding device 
positioned -below the lower one of the hollow spindles. The hollow spindles are rotated as a function of the winding speed of the 
winding davice such that a twist of the spun fibers is at least partially canceled.

(57) Abstract : 
A coupling piece is disclosed for detachably interconnecting the corner fittings of adjacent containers, in particular stacked containers 
on board of ships. In order to reduce manual operations when coupling containers, semi-automatic coupling pieces that need only to be 
manually set on a container and pre-locked are known. Complete locking happens automatically when the containers are stacked. Such 
coupling pieces require however a rel atively complex automatic actuating mechanism, in many respects. In order to simplify the 
automatic actuating mechanism, several mutually offset bearing surfaces (43, 44 and 45) are provided on the locking bolt (21) and 
may be alternatively brought into a corresponding position to a bearing surface (54) on a spring-loaded slide (23). When a bearing 
surface (43, 44 or 45) of the locking bolt (21) lies on the bearing surface (54) of the spring-loaded slide (23), the locking bolt is easily 
and reliably blocked in the desired position of its transverse locking elements (32, 33). (FR) Un Ã©lÃ©ment de raccordement sert Ã  
coupler de maniÃ¨re libÃ©rable les corniÃ¨res de conteneurs adjacents, notamment des conteneurs empilÃ©s Ã  bord de navires. 
Afin de rÃ©duire les manipulations requises pour accoupler des conteneurs, il existe des raccords semi-automatiques qu'il ne faut que 
poser sur un conteneur et prÃ©verrouiller manuellement. Le verrouillage dÃ© finitif aprÃ¨s l'empilage des conteneurs se fait 
automatiquement. Ces raccords requiÃ¨rent toutefois un mÃ©canisme d'actionnement automatique compliquÃ© de plusieurs points 
de vue. Afin de simplifier le mÃ©canisme d'actionnement automatique, plusieurs surfaces d'appui (43, 44 et 45) mutuellement 
dÃ©calÃ©es sont mÃ©nagÃ©es sur l'axe de verrouillage (21) et peuvent Ãªtre alternativement amenÃ©es dans une position de 
correspondance avec une surface d'appui (54) sur un poussoir (23) sollicitÃ© par un ressort. Lorsqu'une surface d'appui (43, 44 ou 45) 
du boulon de verrouillage (21) vient s'appuyer sur la surface d'appui (54) du poussoir (23) sollicitÃ© par un ressort, le boulon de 
verrouillage est bloquÃ© de maniÃ¨re aisÃ©e et fiable, ses Ã©lÃ©ments de verrouillage transversaux (32, 33) se trouvant alors dans 
la position prÃ©vue

(57) Abstract : 
Summary The invention relates to a method for calling up machine and/or production data of a textile machine (M) stored under 
speci fic addresses for display on an optical output unit (3). For the simplification of the interrogation systems known up to now, it is 
proposed that a first switching routine is released via a first initial step by step switch (V2) which, from an existing address field (e.g. 
Ml, 1-1,1.2) in a predetermined switching direction (V,R), leads to the display of the data of the main address immediately following 
!e-g, M2, G) the main addresses (G, Ml to M4) being in a fixed predetermined switching sequence and, over at least one second step 
by step switch (VI), a second switching routine can be released from the existing address field, in each case in a predetermined 
switching direction (V, R), which leads to the display of the data in the specific sequence of the next following address. {Fig.2)

(57) Abstract : 
A planetary gear speed reducer and a machining method for a planetary gear supporting pin which enable the supporting pin to be 
iormed as an integral part of a flange section by forging so as to reduce the number of parts, permit greater ease of assembly, and 
achieve lower cost and also to make it easier to obtain perpendicularity of the supporting pin with respect to the flange section. A 
plurality of supporting pins which are formed in hollow cylindrical shapes are pressed out at equal angle pitches on the same 
circumference on the rear end surface of a fl ange section which is made integral with an output rotary shaft. The front end surface of 
the flange section has recessed sections which are formed coaxially with the supporting pins. The outside diameters of the supporting 
pins are made smaller than the inside diameters of the recessed sections. The distal ends of the supporting pins are open and the 
hollow sections of the supporting pins are communicated with the recessed sections.

(57) Abstract : 
One communications device (called the "impersonating" device) can selectively impersonate another communications device (called 
the "impersonated" device) by arranging the impersonating device to take over and/or use the same network identification number 
(typically stored in an identification number memory and used to control selection of incoming calls to which the device responds) 
normally associated with the impersonated device. As a result of impersonation, there is a hand-off between the devices, with the 
impersonated device becoming dormant and the impersonating device becoming active, such that calls normally received by the 
impersonated device are received by the impersonating device, and such that calls originating in the impersonating device get the 
identical network treatment as would be accorded to calls originated by the impersonated device, all of this without any need to adjust 
or update profiles stored in a network database. Impersonation can be triggered automatically, as by the physical proximity of one 
terminal device to the other, or manually, such as by pushing a button on one of the devices.

(57) Abstract : 
EN) The invention relates to a method for releasing at least one spring-loaded brake (10) that can be actuated by means of a hydraulic 
fluid, said brake being subjected to a brake-release pressure via a connection to a brake-release pressure supply circuit (63) during 
normal operation and for servicing purposes, when the brake-release pressure fails, is disconnected from the brake-rel ease pressure 
supply circuit (63) and is released with the aid of a hydraulic fluid source (37) in opposition to the spring force of the spring-type 
actuator. According to the invention, to improve the method in order to reduce the risk of an accident after a failure of the brake-
release pressure, the brake or brakes (10) is or are automatically re-connected to the brake-release pressure supply circuit (63) once the 
brake-rel ease pressure is again made available. The invention also relates to a device and a hydraulic circuit for carrying out said 
method.

(57) Abstract : 
Paper sheets useful for facial tissues, bath tissues, paper towels, napkins and the like can be made to exhibit a high degree of wet 
resiliency. This property is achieved by using a combination of high yield pulp fibers (such as bleached chemithermomechanical pulp 
fibers) and a wet strength agent in an uncreped throughdrying process. The resulting product, when wetted, can spring back after being 
crumpled in one's hand.

flies manually or automatically according to the avoidance vector, whereby the navigation system prevents an accident from 
happening. [Solving Means] In the navigation system, using a generating line which is of a route predicted by counting a vector 
defined by the speed and the direction of the aircraft in the pieces of el ement data such as a rotating axis, the performance, the air 
stream, and the trouble, a conical area is computed as the cell to manually or automatically perform the avoidance for separating the 
cells.

(57) Abstract : 
Acid and alkaline waste water from a bleach plant comprises different amounts of inorganic and organic material and have varying 
salt contents. The alkaline waste water comprises a great deal of organic material and alkali, whereas the acid waste water primarily 
comprises inorganic salts, such as chlorides and chlorate. If the acid and the alkaline waste water are mixed, it becomes more diffi cult, 
to separate the different substances from the process flew in a subsequent treatment, which is disadvantageous in methods where one 
aims at closing up the bleach plant. Also, problems arise in the processing equipment for the evaporation of waste water compri sing of 
a mixture of acid and alkaline process flows, inter alia as regards the formation of incrustations on heat-transfer surfaces. Another 
problem is that such a mixture results in larger amounts of waste water, which of course is disadvantageous if aiming at closing up the 
bleach plant. This invention relates to an improved method for treating the process waste water from a bleach plant. In the method 
according to the invention, process waste water, which comprise of at least one acid process flow." and one alkaline process flow, is 
treated, the acid and the alkaline process flow being separat ely concentrated in evaporators, whereupon the salt content of the acid 
process flow is reduced by electrodi alysis and the alkaline process flow is combusted. This method enables the recirculated amount of 
water to be reduced and the problems regarding the processing equipment to be avoided, and also contributes to a higher degree of 
closing, even if the bleaching involves chlorine dioxide (ECF).

Abstract This invention is directed toward improving the subjective voice quality of a mobile to mobile phone call having tandem 
vocoder processing by modifying the spectrum of the voice signal before it is processed by the second vocoder to compensate for 
digital distortion which is generated by the second vocoder. An adaptive filter can be used to modify the spectrum of the voice signal. 
With this invention, the voice quality of a call from a first mobile phone to a second mobile phone has a quality that is substantially 
similar to the voice quality of a call from a mobile phone to a desk phone.

(57) Abstract : 
A Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) communication system 1 has a transmitter for transmitting signals over a MIMO Broadcast 
Channel (MIMO- BC) 6. Data for communication to respective receivers 41, 4K-I, 4K is encoded by encoding stages 10l, ..., 10k-1 
10K in a selected order by selecting codewords CIV"CK-I, CK from codebooks CI,...CK-I, CK of a nested lattice code. Dither adders 
11 u .", HK-U 11K are arranged to add a respective dither d1..., dk-1, dk to the selected codewords C1,...Ck-1, Ck. Quantising stages 
12i,..., 12K-I, 12&Kgr; each perform respective quantising operations modAs 1, ..., modAs,k-1,, modals using the shaping lattice As 
of the nested lattice code. Quantised signals u1,..., UK:-I, UK of data encoded earlier in the selected order are output to feedbackward 
filter stages 14i5 ..,, 14K-I for filtering the codewords C1,...Ck-.i, Ck;- of data encoded later in the selected order before they are 
quantised by the quantising stages 12i, ..., 12K. 1 using a feedbackward filter Fb. At the receivers 41, 4K-i, 4K feedforward filter 
stages 151, ..., 15&Kgr; 1 15K filter received signals y1,..,y&kgr;-u y&Kgr; by applying a feedforward filter Ff. A combination of the 
feedbackward and feedforward filters F, Ff is substantially equivalent to a single filter for extracting the signals representing the data 
intended to be communicated to the receivers 41, 4K.b 4K with a minimum mean squared error, but the feedforward filter Ff can be 
applied by each of the receivers 4], ,.,, 4K-b 4K without knowledge of signals y1,..,y &Kgr-1, y&Kgr; received by the other receivers 
41, ..., 4K-b 4K-

(57) Abstract : 
The invention relates to an improved process for the production of a secondary metabolite comprising i) fermentation of a 
microorganism capable of producing said secondary metabolite, and ii) recovering said metabolite in substantially pure form. Said 
microorganism has been modified in a manner whereby the expression of one or more of the DNA sequences coding for (a) peptide(s), 
(a) protein(s) or (an) enzyme(s), involved in or interfering with the biosynthetic pathway of said secondary metabolite, is regulated 
differently from the regulation of said DNA sequence(s) in the original microorganism. Further contemplated is a process for 
production of said microorganism, a DNA construct, a vector or transformation vehicle, a microorganism capable of producing 
secondary metabolite and finally a secondary metabolite product.

(57) Abstract : 
A digital FM demodulator and method for determining phase changes in highly oversampled complex FM digital signals is described. 
In a first embodiment the FM signal is oversampled with respect to the frequency of its associated modulating signal. In this 
embodiment a first digital processing stage delays and conjugates the original FM signal. This delayed conjugated original FM signal 
is then multiplied with the original FM signal to generate a second signal that represents the changes in the phase between samples of 
the original FM signal. A second processing stage then delays and conjugates the second signal. The delayed conjugated second signal 
is then multiplied with the original second signal to generate a third signal that represents changes in the phase between samples of the 
second signal. The imaginary component of the third signal is passed through a digital integrator which outputs the phase changes of 
the original FM signal. In a second embodiment, the highly oversampled signal is oversampled with respect to the deviation frequency 
of its associated modulating signal. In this embodiment the center frequency of the original FM signal is frequency shi fted to 
approximately zero frequency. This frequency shi fted signal is then delayed and conjugated. The delayed conjugated shifted signal is 
then multiplied with the original frequency shift ed signal; yielding an output signal where the imaginary portion of the output signal is 
equal to the phase changes of the original FM signal.

(57) Abstract : 
ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A process and an apparatus for lubricating with multiple phases of lubricants and a multiphase 
lubricant, are described. Lubricants of di fferent phases are used in a process of lubricating one or more operating components which 
are exposed to an operating condition change. Under a condition at which the lubricants are at. least partially miscible, the phases 
combine to provide a lubricant of an improved physical property, such as viscosity. Typically the lubricants are miscible at an elevated 
temperature and immiscible at lower temperatures. A density difference between the phases is preferred for ease of separation. A 
combination of a hydrocarbon oil and a polyalkylene glycol such as polypropylene glycol is preferred.
