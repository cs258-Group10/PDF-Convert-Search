First, the ambiguities on at least two wide-lane carrier-phase measurement differences are obtained 210 by  averaging the corresponding frequency weighted code measurements. These two ambiguity- resolved measurements are then  combined into a composite refraction-corrected measurement 220. The resulting composite measurement is quite noisy due to the  amplification of the multipath noise in the original carrier-phase measurements. But this noisy refraction-corrected carrier-phase  measurement can be smoothed with another minimum-noise, refraction-corrected carrier-phase composite measurement. The  minimum- noise, refraction-corrected composite measurement 230 is constructed from the primary carrier-phase measurements prior  to resolving their whole-cycle ambiguities. By smoothing 240 the difference in the two refraction-corrected measurements, the noise  can be reduced and the bias in the low-noise measurement (due to incorrect ambiguities) can be estimated and subsequently corrected.

The velocity of fluid flow is maintained despite changes in  the viscosity of the cooling fluid, by either increasing or decreasing the amount of torque supplied by the motor. The cooling fluid is  cooled to a desired temperature by circulating the fluid past a multi-path heat exchanging coil connected to a refrigeration system. An  optimal cooing fluid temperature for a variety of applications is in the range of about -24 °C to -26 °C, resulting in significant efficiency  gains over conventional cooling processes.      27 No. of Claims : 56                            The Patent Office Journal 03/07/2009 31172    (12) PATENT APPLICATION PUBLICATION (21) Application No.99/MUM/2001  A  (19) INDIA   29/01/2001 (43) Publication Date : 03/07/2009    POWER SUPPLY APPARATUS FOR ELECTRONIC UNIT    H02M7/10    JAPAN   P2000- 030241  02.02.2000 (86) International Application No  Filing Date    NA    NA   NA  (61) Patent of Addition to Application Number   Filing Date  NA  NA  (62) Divisional to Application Number  Filing Date  NA   NA       1) SONY CORPORATION         7-35, KITASHINGAWA 6-CHOME,  SHINAGAWA-KU, TOKYO, JAPAN     1) KEIJI SHIRATO  2).

The simulated PAN may also incorporate an amount to  be debited from that account. Thus, an account number and an amount are encrypted and mapped into a string of digits which appears  to be a valid PAN. The actual account number and the transaction amount are thus embedded in the simulated PAN. The simulated  PAN is then processed by existing financial transacting infrastructure, with the issuing bank knowing that it is not a PAN and that the  appropriate digits are to be decrypted to provide the embedded account number and the embedded amount. In one application, a  transactor wishing to effect a financial transaction, generates a simulated PAN and supplies it to a supplier of goods or services from  whom he wishes to purchase said goods or services. The supplier enters the simulated PAN and the amount of the transaction in a  conventional way. This data is then transmitted to an acquiring bank, which onwardly transmits it to the issuing bank for authorisation.  The issuing bank then extracts the embedded account number and embedded amount, checks that the embedded amount and the  supplied amount are the same (as well as other conventional checks), and if they are the same authorizes the transaction.

This  method easily establishes a cyclic shift (CS) interval at a specific location having no overlapping by considering a channel response of  a reception (Rx) sequence and an alias location of this reception (Rx) sequence, although a reception (Rx) signal is shifted by a  channel delay spreading or a propagation delay irrespective of categories of a domain generating a sequence, so that it can greatly  reduce the number of the detection errors and the false alarm rate.

A first aspect provides a method of improving on the efficiency of RTP used to transport VoIP voice calls by reducing the  overhead of second and subsequent calls on a link to almost zero using trunking. A second aspect using bandwidth awareness to  compress RTP payload data captured from the network. This involves capturing G.711 encoded RTP data directly from the network (  as opposed to at source ) and transcoding that data in such a way as to take account of the available bandwidth on an outbound link. A  third aspect uses dynamic and transparent packet fragmentation and reassembly based on RTP interval to reduce VoIP latency and  jitter. A fourth aspect uses dynamic re-writing of SIP messages to provides automatic fail-over and load balancing of SIP servers. This  involves capturing SIP call set-up messages and re-writing and duplicating them to direct them to multiple servers. The response is  monitored to determine which server responds most quickly and allowing only that reply back to the source device. A fifth aspect  provides dynamic sizing of trunk payload packets. Given that the above scheme has been set up on a link, it is trivial for the receiving  trunk device to determine if the received packets are too big or small, and to signal the transmitter to adjust its payload size  accordingly.

The system includes  an AIPS (12) and a tank circuit (48) capable of inductively providing power to a remote device (14) at different frequencies, and a  sensor (16) for sensing the reflected impedance of the remote device at tank circuit (48). The system further includes a plurality of  different remote devices (14), each having a unique resonance frequency. In operation, the AIPS (12) is capable of identifying the type  of remote device (14) present in the inductive field by applying power to a remote device (14) at a plurality of unique identification  frequencies until the remote device (14) establishes resonance in response to one of the identification frequencies. The AIPS (12)  includes a controller (40) that recognizes when resonance has been established by evaluating sensor data, which is representative of  the reflected impedance of the remote device (14). Once the identity of a remote device is determined, the AIPS (12) may pull  operating parameters for the remote device (14) from memory (24) to ensure efficient operation and to assist in recognizing fault  conditions.
