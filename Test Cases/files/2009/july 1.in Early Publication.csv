It specifically relates to the preparation of statin nanocrystals. More particularly it relates to the easy and  cost-effective process for preparation of lovastatin nanocrystals and its formulations for convenient oral delivery. Nanocrystals of  lovastatin was prepared by using simple precipitation method to overcome the difficulty of poor solubility and with less concentration  of drug with proper selection of solvent and at proper dilution of drug solution with water, nanocrystals of lesser particle size is  possible with slight change in crystallinity. The nanocrystals of lovastatin showed the enhanced saturation solubility, increased  dissolution rate and more bioavailability in biological fluid.    ",

The controlled drug  delivery formulations in the form of microspheres are developed for parenteral administration of antihypertensive agent. The  controlled drug delivery formulations developed in the form of albumin microspheres for intramuscular administration of Hydralazine  HCl to give during emergency and to avoid complications associated via other routes and with a view of giving a prolonged release of  the Hydralazine HCl. Microspheres were prepared with natural polymer BSA using emulsion polymerization technique or emulsion  cross-linking method. The prepared microspheres proved to be a potential candidate for microparticulate parenteral controlled drug  delivery system.     ",

In this system, acting force due do shocks/bumps is  directed in two ways, from load side as well as bump side. These two ways acting force has also two ways resolving/ resultant force  and get resolved in two shock absorbers, upper and lower shock absorber. So this system reduces shock, bumps impact considerably  and provides better solution to bumps/shocks problem. This system gives more comfort level to passengers and serves the purpose of  effective super suspension system for bike. This, in turn, significantly reduces the physical pain such as back pain and stop subsequent  diseases. It also contributes to the bikes handling to have a good active, safety and driving pleasure.    ",

In  S.I. engine consist of gases like CO,HC, C02, and minor amount of NOx, Sox. And in C.I. engine consist of NOx, Sox, Suspended  particulates matter(SPM),Odour and minor amount of CO2, HC. But NOx is produced at very high temperature about 1100°C. All  these gases are emitted out from smoke through exhaust pipe, however percentage of individual gases present in smoke varies  according to the various technical aspect such as formulation of air fuel mixture, its method of feeding in the combustion chamber.  This device can be joined at the end of silencer not only to I.C. engine but also Incinerators, diesel generator sets. This equipment  useful for all two wheelers (light vehicles) like scooter etc. All three wheelers like auto rickshaw it may be petrol and diesel. And  mostly useful for any type of auto industry which launch his product in the market and all two and three wheelers of OLD and NEW  models. Except cars, omni etc When gas is passed through M.S. S-shape pipe which is connected to S-S304 tank. At the end of s- shape pipe having S-S convergent section due to that pressure of gas decreases and velocity increases. In S-S tank consist of chemical  solution of Soda lime then gas is passed through that; in tank certain amount of height having net on which pallets are kept (silica gel,  limestone, activated carbon)which absorb the odour and certain amount of gases. And finally gas is passes through pipe to the tank;,  process in which removal of gas is very very less effluents gas is passed to atmosphere which is harmless and noise also reduced due  to chemical damping.
