In other words, it is mechanical fingers pressure continuous pouch closure device, which has been designed by  the Applicants. The mechanical fingers pressure movement on the pouch makes the teeth enjoined on its two parallel plastic sides,  e.g., one carrying three teeth & the other carrying four, clasping with each other ensuring the air tight closure of the plastic pouch or  bag from its mouth (top); The present design has a uniqueness of its own for The Plastic Zip Lock does not have any hook or popper  but works only with the pressure of hand movement & is mounted on the top of the plastic pouch or bag from its closed side, as  described in hereafter, which gives the pouch or bag, as the case may be, a very trendy appellation. It is distinctively diverse, new and  extensively high tech improvised design clearly distinguishable, for the reasons set out hereafter, from the mere fasteners doing the  rounds in the market besides that it stands on its own uniqueness. The technology and methodology evolved for formulation and  evolution of The Plastic Zip Lock is such that the strip of the Plastic Zip Lock, as it looks like, is a one piece length of 4 mm width  folded/pressed into double of 2mm width size, the centre of which houses the teeth, 03 (three) on one side & 04 (four) on the other.  Thus, in the final shape, the one top of the Plastic Zip Lock remains open and the bottom remains closed and this very bottom  (closed) side gets mounted/fixed on to the plastic pouch or bag, as the case may be. The Plastic pouch or bag, in order to carry the  intended product, is filled from its (pouchs) bottom side and sealed. The design and its making process have been evolved in such a  manner that makes it possible to be made in all shapes & sizes. The present variant which is 3 & 4 teeth zipper makes one side to get  clung to the other as fast and hard that even air cannot penetrate into the pouch or bag which saves the contents from moistures  deterioration. The sharpness and hardness of the tooth placed on both sides is so tested that the locking faculty does not fail & the lock  remains gripped even on the face of resilient properties of plastic. The Plastic Zip Lock is ideal for lighter to medium weight  contents which are sold through plastic pouches or bags. The distinctive edge which The Plastic Zip Lock carries over so called  fasteners is that the teeth employed in it are so artfully designed & strategically placed in the middle of the two sides of its mouth that  they dont hurt the fingers of the user.

","  1)LARSEN, JAMES DAVID   ","  A method is provided of operating a communication network comprising a plurality of stations. Each station is able to transmit and  receive data so that the network can transmit a message comprising a plurality of data packets from an originating station to a  destination station via at least one opportunistically selected intermediate station. The method includes selecting, at each station, one  or more probing channels for the transmission of probe signals to other stations. Neighbor gathering probe signals are transmitted from  each station on the selected one or more probing channels. Other neighboring stations which receive the neighbor gathering probe  signals from a probing station respond directly, or indirectly via other stations, to thereby indicate to the probing station their  availability as destination or intermediate stations. A station with data to send transmits on one or more of the selected probing  channels, to other neighboring stations that have indicated to the probing station their availability as destination or intermediate  stations, a data transport signal comprising a Request to Send message indicating the need to send data to a particular destination  station or stations and specifying instructions and/or criteria for use by one or more neighboring stations receiving the Request to Send  message. One or more neighboring stations that have indicated to the probing station their availability as destination or intermediate  stations and that receive the Request to Send message, transmit to the station with data to send, a data transport signal. The data  transport signal comprises a first response message including general information indicating the neighboring stations availability as a  destination or intermediate station, and supplementary information in response to the instructions and/or criteria specified by the  station with data to send. At the station with data to send, one or more neighboring stations that transmitted a first response message  are selected opportunistically as recipients of data and/or instructions based on the general information and, where applicable, on the  supplementary information in their first response messages, and at least one data packet is transmitted to the selected neighboring  stations, or one or more additional instructions are sent to the selected neighboring stations and/or to other stations. The first response  message may be a Clear to Send message. Alternatively, the first response message could be an Acknowledgement message or a  Ready to Receive message. In that case the method includes, after the step of the station with data to send transmitting the Request to  Send message, the step of transmitting, from the station with data to send, at least one data packet to the other neighboring stations that  have indicated their availability as destination or intermediate stations. The invention extends to a communication network for  implementing the method.     ",

The GGSN detects  the default APN and sends a RADIUS Accounting request message to a Device Management System DMS (140). The DMS initiates a  device management configuration flow towards the UE using IP over the existing PDP context or an SMS bearer and responds with a  RADIUS Accounting response message to the GGSN.

The paperboard material comprises a paperboard web including wood fibers and expanded  microspheres, and has a relatively low density ranging from about 6 to about 10 Ib/3MSF/mil, a relatively high caliper ranging from  about 24 to about 3 5 mil, and an internal bond strength of at least about 80 x 10-3  ft-lbf., preferably at least 100 x 10-3  lft-Ibf.

Also, the surface of the low  density board may have a Sheffield smoothness of 30 SU or greater compared with the  surface  smoothness of 160 to 200 SU for conventional cupstock, the latter having been thought necessary for adequate print quality. However,  it has been found that the low density board exhibits good printability on flexo printing machines despite its relatively rough surface,  which is surprising and bonus effect realised along with the insulative and other properties of the board.

The present invention has achieved the  design of a series-variety of standard components for the assembly of joints-nodes with variable-self adjusting angles with moving  arms (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) and a series-variety of standard joints-nodes with fixed angles (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) and with the  form of DISC (49) or SPHERE, as well as of a two part mechanical connector consisting of a male (47) and a female (48) part, which  can be interconnected with lateral movement and interlock with a small turn and can be fixed at the ends of straight parts (21) (25) and  be embedded in the arms of the nodes (3) (4) (5) (6) (7), as well as the devising of a method of screwing and unscrewing straight parts  (21) (25) by turning in one or the other direction with opposite threadings at their two ends (22R) (23L) and respectively at the arms  (3L) (3R) (4L) (4R) (5L) (5R) (6L) (6R) (7L) (7R) of the nodes.
