It is based on the notion transmit the  changed only. This means only when there is considerable change in the scene that information needs to be transmitted. This is done  by motion detection at the senders end and sending only the required frames. The system defines a local motion frequency function  (LMFF) for tracking. This function is based on offline learning using machine learning techniques such as SVM, neural networks etc.  The function is trained on when to give a scene change indication. When there is delta change, which is negligible from the  perspective of human perception, this LMFF function will send a message\flag to the receiver stating that the earlier frame can be  displayed again. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method for video conferencing at ultra low  bandwidth comprising the steps of: capturing the first I-frame at senders end, storing the I-frame in a reference buffer and transmitting  the frame to a receiver; detecting the motion of a next frame at senders end with the help of a local motion frequency function (IMFF)  with respect to the reference frame stored in said reference buffer to determine if there is substantial change in scene; and when  motion detected is beyond a threshold value, giving an indication for transmitting the changed scene to the receiver.

The method results in enhanced secrecy of the original data and the mapping on the data.
